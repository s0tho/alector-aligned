Satellites are devices sent into space.
They receive and then send TV programs or weather data, they take pictures of our planet.
If all the satellites broke down, we wouldn't have the weather!
In addition, TV images sent from other continents would no longer arrive live.
The football games would be aired late.
But everything wouldn't stop, we'd keep the internet.
The data of the Net pass through cables or fiber optics in the ground or at the bottom of the oceans.
We'd always listen to the radio.
Satellites connect men.
The GPS system uses 30 satellites to cover our land.
The plane uses its GPS to locate itself.
GPS gives us our position on the road.
