In general, the colours of an animal or plant have a purpose.
Birds distinguish colours very well.
In many bird classes, males are coloured to attract insects.
Some animals, which are poisonous or have an unpleasant smell, wear remarkable colours as a warning.
For example, wasps are easily recognized by their yellow and black bands, and birds quickly understand that they are stung if they attack insects carrying these bands.
But not all colored animals are necessarily poisonous.
There are harmless flies that don't sting and mimic wasps.
Other animals protect themselves by making themselves almost invisible.
They look like leaves.
