Cocoa trees grow in the warm and humid areas of the tropics, in Africa, America and Asia.
It blooms twice a year. The flowers give fruits called cabosses.
They are harvested by hand, twice a year.
Each contains 30 to 50 violet beans, surrounded by pulp.
These beans are piled in the sun, on banana leaves or in baskets and then covered.
They're closing for a few days.
This makes it possible to remove the pulp and develop the aroma.
Then the beans are dried in the sun or in an oven to remove the rest of the water.
They turn brown.
Put in bags, they leave, by boats, mainly in Europe.
The dried beans go to the chocolate shop.
They are stored in silos and controlled.
Then, the shells are broken to recover the almonds, which are cocoa seeds.
Then they are roasted, i.e. roasted in ovens.
This releases their aroma and reduces their humidity.
Finally, almonds are heated and crushed in shredders.
The cocoa paste comes out of it.
She has a very bitter taste.
Part of this dough is heated and pressed.
The cocoa butter comes out of it.
It's pale yellow.
Filtered, molded and cooled, it will be used to make chocolate in tablets.
In the press, reddish cakes are still known as cakes.
They are crushed until they get a very fine powder: cocoa powder.
To this powder, are added sugar, vanilla and flours of bananas, wheat, barley, to get the chocolate powder that you mix with your milk at breakfast.
The rest of the cocoa paste is mixed with a small portion of cocoa butter.
Sugar and vanilla, for example, are then added.
This mixture is made in large tanks called conches.
It's the conch.
The dough, heated to 60 Â°C, is brewed, agitated, kneading for 24 to 72 hours.
It is at this moment that chocolate takes its finesse, its aroma.
The rest of the cocoa butter is added at the end of the conch.
The cooled paste is distributed in moulds that pass through a cold tunnel.
At the exit, the tablets are demolished.
