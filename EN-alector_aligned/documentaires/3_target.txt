390 million years ago, the adventure of forests begins.
This interesting and mysterious world is still little known. 4 billion hectares of trees cover 30% of the land of our planet.
The forest environment is a medium fed by solar energy stored as in a pile -wood- made with carbon dioxide (CO2), water and nourishing elements taken from the soil.
The bare rocks and soils, dry or wet, sunny or not, are occupied by so-called pioneer plants because they settle first. They form the humus.
The rock is used under the multiplied effect of frost, heat, water and wind. The wind brings the spores of mushrooms, mosses, lichens and ferns.
The seeds sail on rivers and oceans, the lightest of which are transported by the scavengers and plumage of migratory birds.
They land on the shores. A phytocenosis, a plant community, settles according to the water resource.
A variety of flora then shrubs and the first trees occupy these bare habitats.
This plant mixture progresses, its complexity also: the tree, then the forest results from this evolution.
In the forest, the perspiration of plants represents 25 to 50 m3 of water per day and per hectare.
This perspiration and evaporation of soil and surface water constitute the general evapotranspiration. This evapotranspiration forms clouds.
Forest soil is a sponge that controls the flow of water, fills the underground reserves and magnifies the sources.
The forest is also the guardian of oxygen and sets the carbon of the air.
Tree peaks stop the violent winds that cut down other more fragile trees.
The plant recovery cycle then begins.
The forest is also a privileged environment of animal and plant species still little known, an important reserve of species, an air conditioner for soils.
Thanks to fungi, bacteria and other tiny species, the forest soil is a plant that recovers organic materials. The forest soil restores nourishing elements to the growing roots.
Roots pump water, mineral salts and fix the tree. It grows.
