Trees grow almost everywhere, except in the ice, the eternal snow, on the tops of the high mountains and in the deserts.
When a piece of land is long enough abandoned, trees grow fast.
First, the earth covers itself with creeping plants.
Then bushes grow and some plants die.
Then the trees begin to grow.
When they grow up, some bushes in their shadow die.
Thus, over time, a forest is formed. Most trees grow slowly and some can become very old.
When the trees die, young people come out and replace them.
Forests are a natural cover. It may not change for a long time.
Forests are almost everywhere.
