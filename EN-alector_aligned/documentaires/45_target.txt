Algae are plants.
Algae have been in existence for more than 3 billion years, the first forms of life on earth.
Many marine animals eat algae.
Algae are the beginning of food chains that go to whales.
Some algae are very small, they are not seen with the naked eye. Others are giant.
They are green, red, blue or brown.
They live in salty or fresh water, sometimes out of water. They always need light to live.
Algae are plants, they have no root, stem, leaf, or flower.
On earth, the blue algae arrived first, then the reds and finally the greens and the browns.
Plants on earth come from green algae.
To feed, algae make sugars from water and gas mixed in water. They use sunlight as a source of energy. It's called photosynthesis.
At the same time, they throw oxygen.
Algae produce more than half the oxygen in our air.
Seaweeds also pump mineral salts from seawater to feed themselves.
Without seaweed, there would be no animals.
Everyone can take the algae near the water. They are important for life on earth.
