Spiders were previously believed to be protected from glue from their own webs, while flies and other insects do not have this protection.
But that's not true.
A spider would lock itself in its own web if it did not use a trick.
In fact, spiders can spun two kinds of threads. That's why spiders first build a web of dry threads that don't stick.
When it's finished, the spider runs over the sticky material.
It is this second canvas on the first one that imprisons the unlucky insects.
In order not to get out of the fight itself, the spider leaves passages in his web.
These free passages are placed so skillfully that the spider can reach every point of the web without taking himself in.
