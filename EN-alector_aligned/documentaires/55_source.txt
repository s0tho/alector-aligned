When I was little, in school or in books, we were told that dinosaurs had disappeared several tens of millions of years ago because of strong volcanic eruptions or the fall of a giant meteorite.
We were also told that all that remains of them today are the fossils and skeletons that are seen in museums.
I didn't think that one day I would feel the opposite, and yet that's what scientists do today.
Of course, stegosaurus, tritratops and diplodocus have disappeared, but there are still real dinosaurs in our time.
There are even many, in all countries, in cities, forests, gardens and sometimes even in houses.
These current dinosaurs are birds!
From the smallest to the largest, whether they eat seeds or meat, all birds are dinosaurs.
They may no longer have teeth, or a long lizard tail, but the birds are of the same family as the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor.
This family is called the theropods.
It was by comparing bird skeletons with those of other theropods exposed in museums that scientists observed many commonalities and understood that there was a relationship.
For example, the hind legs of birds and those of ancient theropods have only three fingers that allow them to stand.
Another resemblance is the presence of a V-shaped bone or Y-shaped bone called the fork.
In other vertebrate animals, this bone is separated in two and forms the clavicles (they are the ones that attach the front legs to the rest of the skeleton).
