In very hot and dry areas, plants and animals must adapt to climatic conditions.
During the dry period, many plants survive in the form of seeds that often remain buried in the soil for several years and only germinate when it rains.
Then the plants grow very quickly and form flowers and seeds that, at the right time, develop into a new generation.
Some animals behave in the same way.
The frogs bury themselves and surround themselves with a shell that prevents them from drying out.
These frogs only come to the surface when it rains and take advantage of that moment for their reproduction.
Many plants in the desert have adapted differently to drought.
Some have roots with extensive branching.
