There are dangers to animals and plants: they are afraid that they will be eaten.
Some animals may disguise themselves while others may hide.
Some of them are fast and they can flee from their enemies.
Plants, which cannot flee, have found other ways to protect themselves, such as sharp bites and thorns.
Other plants and some animals protect themselves with poison.
This poison isn't all the time deadly.
It's useful if it prevents us from eating them.
Some animals, like some flies, protect themselves and disguise themselves like animals that have poison.
In animals, a very bright colour indicates that the animal should not be eaten.
The wasp, for example, has yellow and black stripes.
