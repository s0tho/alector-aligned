From time to time, your brain plays tricks on you, which you'd do well.
Have you noticed, for example, that some people are ill in transportation?
Do you know why? It's from your brain.
Your brain, is an organ that receives a lot of information from different parts of your body (either from the outside, from the environment, or from the inside of the body itself).
Then he processes this information to make you react (e.g. run in the face of a danger) or to activate other mechanisms (e.g. find balance when you move) or to simply store them in order to use them later (e.g. memorization).
Anyway, it's like a big computer that controls everything your body does.
Now, what happens when you're in the back of your parents' car and you're doing something other than looking at the scenery, for example, you're reading?
The sensors of your retina receive information from the book. Sensitive nerves will make the information pass to an area of your brain that will interpret it: I am still reading a book.
On the other hand, the rest of your body also gives guidance to your brain about what you're doing.
Your ears in particular contain organs, which inform your brain that you're moving.
So your brain receives two contradictory information and it fails to connect the two pieces of the riddle.
On one side I move, on the other, I am still reading.
So this inner conflict generates vertigo, you're not feeling well.
The driver does not have these unpleasant sensations: his eyes and ears give his brain the same information.
