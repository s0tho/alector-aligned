In the Middle East, ALEP's SAVON is as famous as Marseille soap in France.
It is said that a woman, cleaning her fat-filled pot with ashes, would have found a material that became soap.
The Romans and the Gauls also had their soap.
The recipe is simple: you need olive oil, caustic soda, water and perfume.
The production of soap has evolved thanks to the important cultivation of olive trees and the presence of a plant, salsola kali, which grows in the desert of Syria.
Salsola Kali, the plant of the steppe, was burned by the Bedouins who carried it to the soap shops.
But the irregular harvest favoured its replacement with caustic soda. Fragrances, such as bay oil or styrax essence, were added on demand.
Saponification: it is the process of transforming a fat material into soap.
The caustic soda, mixed with water, is poured on the olive oil already heated in a cooking tank.
A worker, with a shovel, stirs this mixture that cooks for several hours at 80 Â°C. Soap is in production.
At the end of the cooking process, the paste is watered with pure water to bring the dirt to the bottom of the tank.
Then start the stretch.
The dough is drawn from the tank with a bucket. Then it is spread over a flat surface and equalized with a spatula.
After several hours of drying, the surface is gridded.
Each square marked is cut with a thread to cut the butter.
Finally comes the drying: the soap cubes are transported in a dry and aerated place where 650 cubes form a tower.
After 40 days, the towers are disassembled and then reassembled by turning the cubes to dry the other faces.
15 days later, the towers are reassembled and the soaps transported to a warehouse.
Covered with a jute canvas, they continue to dry.
The more dry a soap is, the more precious it is.
Before the sale, a worker equalizes the faces and packs them in 30 kg bags.
The waste, kept for laundry, gives soap powder.
When cutting, four cubes of soap weigh one kilo.
At the time of sale, it takes 6 for the same weight.
