At night, the hedgehog walks under the hedge and also spends in your garden.
It has a small pointed snout that is perfect for hunting worms and slugs from the garden.
But he's doing a lot of raffut.
It is therefore easy to discover this prickly ball eating a worm in the lawn or chewing a small snail on the salads of the vegetable garden.
He does not see very well, but spot his food under the leaves thanks to his flair or his hearing.
The gardeners thank him because, thanks to him, the vegetable garden is rid of all the small animals eating vegetables and fruits, no need for pesticides.
In one night, the hedgehog can chew 60 worms or larvae and a good dozen large slugs.
He also likes eggs and fallen fruits.
The little ones nibble following their mother
At the fall of the night the hedgehog leaves in search of his prey under the hedge.
During the winter, the hedgehog is an animal that hibernates five months on a nest of grasses and leaves.
When he wakes up in early spring, he is particularly hungry.
The hedgehog is a victim of anti-lima, road and hedge suppression, its natural habitat.
It therefore finds refuge in parks and gardens for the greatest happiness of gardeners.
