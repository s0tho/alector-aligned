For a third of your life you're going to sleep.
Every animal sleeps, it's mandatory to live. Not everyone does it at the same time.
Man has phases of sleep and awakening due to day-night change.
During sleep, several cycles follow: light slow sleep, deep slow sleep and paradoxical sleep.
When the sun sets, a gland releases the hormone from sleep that helps you fall asleep: melatonin.
This gland is located in your brain and is called pineal gland because it looks like a pine apple.
At your age, you sleep very quickly, no noise can wake you up, it's the role of slow sleep.
Meanwhile, your body is resting, your memory is strengthening, hormones are produced, especially the growth hormone that allows you to grow.
You dream especially during your paradoxical sleep. Your brain needs as much energy as the day to invent crazy stories.
Nightmares scare you, but dreaming is good for your health.
