There are 500,000 caves in France.
It is in the calcareous soils of the South that we find the most caves.
For a cave to form, it takes water and a rock, limestone.
After a few thousand years, it gives a hollow cavity like a gruy√®re, the cave was born.
Rainwater infiltrates a cave, digs it and brings it minerals.
So a cave is still in formation.
Five million years ago, the level of the Mediterranean Sea was one kilometre lower than today.
Then caves were dug at more than 1 Kilometer below the current surface.
There's probably more to discover.
In 1947, a fluo green powder was put in the water of the Padirac gulf (46) to know its way.
It reappeared three months after eleven kilometers from there. The course of the water under the earth can therefore be long.
Geologists study caves to find deep water reservoirs.
However, speleologists cannot access certain water tanks.
An amphibious robot sneaks in to take all measurements.
Speleologists also throw special logs into the river that advance and give their position.
So we can draw the map of the river.
