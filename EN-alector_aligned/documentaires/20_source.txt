A strawberry that tastes like strawberry... no wonder.
But that a strawberry-flavoured yogurt that never crossed the road of a red fruit tastes like it, is more surprising.
It's all about chemistry.
The smell and taste of a food comes from the aromas it contains.
Fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, seafood and mushrooms naturally secrete many of them.
These aromas are modified by ripening, fermentation or cooking.
These aromas are present in very small quantities and they evaporate easily, except in spices and aromatic herbs. The so-called "natural" aromas are derived from plant or animal products.
The synthetic flavours are artificially manufactured but have the same chemical composition as the natural flavours.
Flavors "meat" or "poil", "caramel" or "roasted" are obtained by heating a mixture of sugar and nitrogen products.
The food industries are major users of these synthetic flavours.
For reasons of economy first: one kilo of synthetic vanillin is 200 times less expensive than one kilo of natural vanillin.
For a question of taste too, because the aromas are in large quantities destroyed during the manufacture of food products.
It is therefore necessary to "replenish" the original tastes in order to satisfy the consumer.
Because aromas slip everywhere: in sweets, dairy products, cakes, cooked dishes, sauces, soups, fruit juices.
