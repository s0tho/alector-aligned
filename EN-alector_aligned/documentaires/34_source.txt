The cephalopods are fascinating animals from many points of view, not just because they have their feet on their heads.
Today, I'm just talking about their incredible camouflage and transformation faculties.
Octopuses or cuttlefish can change colour, texture and shape extremely quickly: they blend into the decor to protect themselves from predators or, on the contrary, impress them with dissuasive colours and shapes.
Many cephalopods (largely tentacle molluscs) have this capacity called homochromy.
The display of scrolling colours also serves as a romantic parade in the dry land.
How does it work? Well, a little like an LCD screen.
Like us, the animal captures images of its environment with its eyes and this information is transmitted in the form of electrical signals to the brain.
Its skin consists of two layered layers of different cells that are all capable of changing color.
The top layer is composed of red, yellow, brown and black chromatophores. They are cells that can fill or drain from coloured pigments.
The bottom layer is composed of cells containing crystals that modify the returned light (mostly blue and green), allowing the animal to display metallic reflections or become "gloss".
These cells are like pixels on a screen.
The combination and combination of pixels create a complete color palette.
The cephalopods can control these cells to modulate the colors of their skin almost as they wish.
Even better: the seiches can modify the polarization of light, thanks to the layer of the underside, which allows them to communicate with each other.
A small zoom on the mimetic octopus
This species discovered in Indonesia in the 1990s adds to the art of camouflage that of imitation.
This octopus mimics the behavior of other species.
It takes the form of a sea snake or a flat fish at the bottom.
Sometimes you don't know what she's imitating.
