In very hot and dry areas, plants and animals have to get used to the weather.
During the dry period, many plants live in the form of seeds. They remain hidden in the soil for several years and grow when it rains.
The plants grow very quickly and form flowers and seeds. They become new plants.
A few animals do the same.
The frogs bury themselves and surround themselves with a shell that prevents them from being dry.
These frogs come to the surface when it rains. They take advantage of that moment to reproduce.
Many plants in the desert have become accustomed to dry weather otherwise.
Some have very long roots.
