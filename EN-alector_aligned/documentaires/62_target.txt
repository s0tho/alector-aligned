The island is called the pieces of land cut off from the continent and surrounded by the sea.
The islands can be born when volcanoes come out of the bottom of the sea or when the sea level drops or rises.
Many islands were born at the end of the glacial period.
When the ice melts, the water flows into the sea. The water level of the sea becomes high. The earth, which is lower, is covered with water.
Today, only the highest pieces of land come out of the sea in the shape of islands.
Animals and plants that have arrived on a remote island can no longer leave it.
If they want to live, they are forced to get used to their new place of life very quickly.
For the living beings who come from the islands, there has always been a certain danger of disappearing.
