There was a time when the mill was used to grind grains of wheat to obtain flour.
In prehistory, at the time of the first farmers, our ancestors crushed the grains of wheat between two stones to obtain flour.
Later, they imagined making a back and forth movement with a stone held in hand on another stone.
The rotating wheel was discovered about 2,000 years ago.
One stone, the dormant, did not move while the other, the turn, moved and crushed the grains.
This stone was moved by animals or men.
At the same time, engineers imagined turning the wheel by using the force of water, thanks to large wheels.
This intelligent invention has made twenty times as much flour as with the rotating wheel.
In France and England, the first windmills were built in the Middle Ages.
They were positioned at the top of a hill to receive the wind.
The wind rotated the 4 wings that put the wheel in action.
The interior of the mill consisted of a round room on the ground floor.
In the past, the miller warmed this space with a fireplace.
From there, a stone staircase climbed to the floors reserved for the storage of bags and grinding wheels.
Although windmills have been replaced by industrial mills, we can still find the coffee mill and pepper mill in our kitchens.
