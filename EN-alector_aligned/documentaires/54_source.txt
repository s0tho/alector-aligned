Shells are animals with a soft body and shell.
They are part of the mollusc family.
There are mainly two large kinds of shells.
The bivalves are shells with the shell formed by two attached parts.
Each part is called valve.
Gastropods are shells formed from a single shell in one part.
In man, the skeleton is inside the body.
In shells, the skeleton is outside, it's the shell.
It grows from the edges.
The shell can be reformed if it is damaged.
It is mainly made up of calcium, as for human bones.
Shells have a wide variety of size, thickness, shape, colour and surface.
Their colours come from their food.
Certain lines of the shell allow to know the age of the animal, in the same way as for the trees.
The soft body is made of three parts: the foot; the bag that contains the stomach, the intestine, the heart, the liver, the kidneys; the coat that covers the whole and makes the shell.
Some shells have mouths.
Others have eyes that allow them to distinguish between shadows and movements.
Some can also smell.
Shellfish feed on plankton.
Some are herbivores, others carnivores.
Shellfish have predators.
The star of the sea attacks the bivalves.
She manages to remove the valves from the shell.
She takes her oesophagus and stomach out of her body and then introduces them into the shell. She aspires to it and digests it.
Crabs use their powerful pliers to open or break the shell.
Some seabirds, such as gulls, completely swallowed the shell and digested the shell.
