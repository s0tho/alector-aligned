The term Squirrel applies to several animals that belong to the Sciuridae family and are climbing rodents with a tufted plume tail.
There are about 265 species of these mammals worldwide.
These friendly little animals are also known for their eagerness to make provisions for the winter.
Squirrels are agile and fast.
We can see them jump from branch to branch.
The alarm cry is a quick tap (couch, cuckold, cuckold, cuckold, etc.).
Sometimes several squirrels gather to steal a predator; they then cry out by shaking the tail.
The tail of the squirrel has many uses.
It acts as a rudder when the animal jumps from high places; it acts as a parasol when a clumsy squirrel falls; it serves as a cover during the winter.
The tail allows to indicate to the other squirrels the intentions of an individual.
Finally the squirrel uses the tail to distract its predators.
The fur of the squirrel is thicker and longer in winter.
Generally, the squirrel builds a leaf nest near the top of a tree or at a fork or on a branch near the trunk.
A platform made of twigs forms the base of the nest, and interlaced leaves and twigs form the outside of the nest.
The interior frame is usually made of intertwined leaves and branches.
Foam, grass and shredded bark line the interior, but squirrels can use bird tissue, paper, plants and feathers.
The gestation period of squirrels is approximately 40 days.
Each year, they have one or two litters and the number of young per litter is, on average, three to six.
The average lifespan of squirrels is 4 to 6 years, but in captivity the squirrel can live 15 to 20 years.
Moreover, the squirrel is the prey of many predators, including mink, marten, weasel, pekan, lynx, fox, coyote, owl, etc.
In the boreal forest, red squirrels feed mainly on seeds from conifer cones.
It also eats acorns, hazelnuts, seeds, buds, insects, bark, flowers, berries, mushrooms, bird eggs and chicks.
In the spring, the squirrel loves maple sap. Squirrels live all over the world.
