When I was a kid, at school or in the books, it was learned that dinosaurs had disappeared millions of years ago. It was because of strong volcanic eruptions or the fall of a giant meteorite.
We were shown that all that remains of them today are fossils and skeletons that are seen in museums.
I didn't think I'd ever feel the opposite, but that's what scientists do today.
Of course, stegosaurus, tritratops and diplodocus have disappeared, but there are still real dinosaurs in our time.
There are even many, in all countries, in cities, forests, gardens and sometimes even in houses.
These current dinosaurs are birds!
From the smallest to the largest, whether they eat seeds or meat, all birds are dinosaurs.
They may no longer have teeth, or a long lizard tail, but the birds are of the same family as the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor.
This family is called the theropods.
Scientists compared bird skeletons with skeletons of other theropods exposed in museums, observed many commonalities, and understood that there was a relationship.
For example, the back legs of birds and the legs of ancient theropods have only three fingers to stand.
Another link is a V-shaped bone or Y-shaped bone called the fork.
In other vertebrate animals, this bone is separated in two and forms the clavicles (they are the ones that attach the front legs to the rest of the skeleton).
