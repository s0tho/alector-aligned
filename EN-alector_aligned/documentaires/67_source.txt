You have surely already crossed the path of shells to the repulsive aspect and yet very much appreciated by many people: oysters.
Today we will let you discover that beyond their image, they can turn out to be real goldsmiths.
Oysters are part of the family of bivalve molluscs, which have a shell that can open in two parts and live on different supports such as rocks or buried under various sediments (sand, mud, etc.).
Very numerous in some countries, these shells are both appreciated as food as well as as as pearl makers, at the origin of many jewels.
But then how can this animal make this?
For the oyster it is a way to heal and stop a form of external aggression.
The responsible? Small grains of rock or sand inviting themselves inside his shelter and may subsequently cause strong irritations in his body.
Of course, the oyster cannot scratch or expel the intruder, so it wraps this foreign body with a substance that it usually secretes in order to build its shell.
This one is called calcium carbonate, a very specific name for a matter you probably know: mother-of-pearl.
The grain is then coated with different layers that over time and number, will be able to influence the shape and shine of the final result.
And hop! The grain being finally covered there is no more irritation and so here we are with a little pearl.
This production is therefore primarily a means of removing the discomfort caused by this grain.
There are then different types of these "jewels" depending on the foreign grain and shell, ranging from magnificent pearls to simple pebbles of colours, varying according to the different species.
In order to increase production, some of these animals are then the object of large farms where small balls are manually inserted to be covered, thus forming pearls artificially.
These implants are sometimes rejected, ingested or can cause the death of the animal, a goal that is therefore not without danger for these shells.
