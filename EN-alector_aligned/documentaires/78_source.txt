Humans have always wanted to discover unknown territories, travel in space or live on another planet.
Life in space, outside the atmosphere, has very special conditions.
In space there is no water or air. The temperature is very low in the shade (-150 to -200 °C), it can become extremely high (+200 °C) under the direct effect of radiation.
To live in the space vacuum, man must place himself in a "bubble" (vessel or scaphandre) where he will have restored earthly living conditions (air, temperature of about 20°C) and where he will be able to eat, drink, sleep, live in good conditions.
Before going into space, astronauts must be in perfect physical condition. They do a lot of sports before their mission.
They also have to undergo intensive training to cope with their new living conditions.
Astronauts must prepare themselves to live in weightlessness, not to have the evil of space.
An orbital station allows several people to live several months in space. Inside the astronauts do not need to scapandre. The station contains air, while outside it is empty.
The crew works mainly in astronomy, research, medical experiments or technical experiments.
The crew must also keep the ship in good condition.
The assembly of the space station elements requires exits outside the ship.
Men must wear heavy scaphandres that ensure their survival in space.
They are then connected to the station by one or two safety cords.
Astronauts carry out many works in space.
