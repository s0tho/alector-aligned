At the South Pole, men cannot fall from the Earth: they do not have their heads upside down.
Looking at a globe we might think an Australian has his head down.
Yet this is not the case.
The Australian, like the French, is attracted to the center of the Earth.
A force attracts everything on the surface and around the Earth.
It's weightlessness.
Thus, for all the inhabitants of the Earth, the "top" is always towards the sky and the "bottom" towards the ground.
Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, in space, the astronaut and his capsule are far from the earth.
They are always subject to the gravity of our planet.
But as they gained a certain speed at the launch, they constantly revolve around it, they are satellited.
They're in a state of impoverishment.
The weightlessness (or weightlessness) is not the absence of gravity but the combination of this gravity with a certain speed of movement.
They're floating in space.
In the same way, two masses in the Universe (e.g. two planets) will necessarily be attracted.
The earth is attracted to the Sun.
Why does she not fall on him? Because she moves, so she revolves around.
If the Earth moved less quickly, it would crash on the Sun; if it moved faster, it would escape from the solar system.
It's a well-set system.
