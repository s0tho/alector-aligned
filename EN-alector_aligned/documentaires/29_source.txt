From our planet, astronomers observe the universe.
In the sky, we see the Sun, the clouds, at night, we contemplate the Moon and the stars....
Long before us, the first men saw that the stars were moving during the night.
The Egyptians had drawn maps of the sky and knew the movements of the planets.
In South America the Mayan peoples have built pyramids.
Today the scientists realize that they had built them in relation to the sky.
Still in our day, we don't know everything.
Every day, researchers (astronomers, astrophysicists) study the solar system and the universe: they make new discoveries.
The light of the Sun emits all the colors.
Terrestrial air is a filter.
The sky of our planet is blue.
Without the atmosphere, the sky would be black.
That's the case on the moon.
In a space shuttle, astronauts simultaneously see the sun and the stars on a black sky background: space is a "black light".
Without atmosphere on Earth we could see the stars in broad daylight.
The atmosphere envelops the earth.
One part consists of an incalculable number of very fine particles of dust and microscopic water droplets.
The light is made up of all the colors of the rainbow.
The rays of light hit the molecules (very fine particles) of the air.
When the radius is blue, it is scattered (distributed).
The other colours are retained.
That's why we see the blue sky.
Depending on the air quality, the dust returns yellow waves and adds a yellow tint to the sky.
In the mountains, the sunny days show a deep blue sky, because the air is very clean, that is, without dust or moisture.
On the other planets, the sky will have a different shade because it depends on the composition of its atmosphere.
