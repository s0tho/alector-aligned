The cephalopods are interesting animals for several reasons, other than their feet on the head.
Today, I'm going to talk about their curious camouflage and transformation capabilities.
Octopuses or cuttlefish can change colour, texture and shape quickly. They disappear in the decor to protect themselves from predators or they impress predators by showing them repulsive colors and shapes.
Many cephalopods (largely tentacle molluscs) have this capacity called homochromy.
At the cuttlefish, displaying scrolling colors also serves to seduce.
How does it work? Well, a little like an LCD screen.
Like us, the animal captures images of its environment with its eyes. This information is transmitted in the form of electrical signals to the brain.
The animal's skin is made up of 2 layers of different superimposed cells that can all change color.
The top layer is made of red, yellow, brown and black chromatophores. They are cells that can fill or drain from coloured pigments.
The layer of the underside is made of cells containing crystals that change the light returned (mostly blue and green) and allow the animal to show metallic reflections or become "glossy".
These cells are like pixels on a screen.
The mix of pixels creates a complete color palette.
The cephalopods control these cells to change the colors of their skin almost as they want.
Even better: the seciches can change the brightness of the colours to communicate with each other, thanks to the layer on the bottom.
A small zoom on the mimetic octopus
This species discovered in Indonesia in the 1990s also knows how to imitate.
This octopus mimics the behavior of other species.
It takes the form of a sea snake or a flat fish at the bottom of the sea.
Sometimes you don't know what she's imitating.
