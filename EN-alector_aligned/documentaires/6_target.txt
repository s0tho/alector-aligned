Cocoa trees grow in the warm and humid areas of the tropics, in Africa, America and Asia.
It blooms twice a year. The flowers give fruits called cabosses.
They're hand-picked twice a year.
In each, 30 to 50 violet beans are surrounded by pulp.
We put these beans in the sun, on banana leaves or in baskets, and then we cover them.
They're closing for a few days.
Thus, the pulp falls and the aroma develops.
Then the beans dry in the sun or in an oven to remove the rest of the water.
They turn brown.
In bags, they leave, by boats, especially in Europe.
The dried beans go to the chocolate shop.
They are stored in silos and controlled.
Then we break the shells to take the almonds. Almonds are cocoa seeds.
These seeds are then roasted, i.e. roasted in ovens.
Thus, their aroma is released and their humidity decreases.
Finally, almonds are heated and crushed in shredders.
The cocoa paste comes out of it.
She has a very bitter taste.
Part of this dough is heated and pressed.
The cocoa butter comes out of it.
It's pale yellow.
Filtered, molded and cooled, it is used to make chocolate in tablets.
In the press, reddish cakes are left: cakes.
We crush these cakes to get a very fine powder: cocoa powder.
To this powder, we add sugar, vanilla and banana flour, wheat, barley to get the chocolate powder. You put this powder in your milk at breakfast.
What's left of cocoa paste is mixed with a little cocoa butter.
Sugar and vanilla are then added.
This mixture is made in large tanks called conches.
It's the conch.
The dough, heated to 60 Â°C, is brewed, agitated, kneading for 24 to 72 hours.
At that time chocolate takes its finesse, its aroma.
The rest of the cocoa butter is added at the end of the conch.
The cooled dough is poured into mussels. They pass through a cold tunnel.
When we get out, we're pulling the tablets out.
