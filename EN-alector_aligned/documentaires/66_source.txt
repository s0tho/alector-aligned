You're gonna spend a third of your life sleeping, but it's not a waste of time.
All animals sleep, it's mandatory to live but not all do it at the same time.
In man, the phases of sleep and awakening are related to day-night alternation.
When you sleep, there are several cycles of sleep: light slow sleep, deep slow sleep and paradoxical sleep.
In the evening, when sunlight drops a small gland releases the hormone from sleep that helps you fall asleep: melatonin.
This gland is called great pineal because it has the shape of a pine apple, it is located in the heart of your brain.
At your age, you sleep very quickly, no noise can wake you up, it's the role of slow sleep.
During this phase, your body restes, your memory strengthens, and hormones essential to you are produced: especially the growth hormone, which allows you to grow.
You dream especially during your paradoxical sleep. Inventing abracadabrant stories requires your brain as much energy as it does the day.
Nightmares scare you, but dreaming is good for your health.
