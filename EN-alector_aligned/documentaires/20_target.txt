A strawberry that tastes like strawberry... nothing unusual.
But if a strawberry-flavoured yogurt that has never crossed the road of a red fruit tastes like strawberry, it's crazy.
It's all about chemistry.
The smell and taste of a food comes from its aromas.
Fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, seafood and mushrooms spread many aromas.
These aromas are modified by ripening, fermentation or cooking.
These aromas are present in very small quantities and evaporate easily, except in spices and aromatic herbs.
The so-called "natural" flavours come from plant or animal products. Synthetic flavours are manufactured but they have the same chemical combination as natural flavours.
The flavours "meat" or "poil", "caramel" or "roasted" are obtained by heating sugar and nitrogen products.
The food industries use synthetic flavours.
For reasons of economy: one kilo of synthetic vanillin is 200 times less expensive than one kilo of natural vanillin.
For a question of taste too, because the aromas are in large quantity destroyed during the manufacture of food.
It is therefore necessary to "replenish" the original tastes in order to satisfy the consumer.
Because aromas are everywhere: in sweets, dairy products, cakes, cooked dishes, sauces, soups, fruit juices.
