Earth attracts the Moon and the Moon attracts the Earth.
This phenomenon is called attraction.
The real term is gravitational attraction.
It is the force that any mass exerts on another in the universe.
It is the oceans that are most sensitive to this attraction because they are liquid.
They are therefore deformable.The sea rises and descends twice in 24 hours.
The oceans deform when the moon passes before them.
Water, which is in front of the Moon, is attracted.
It "goes up".
When the water has finished rising the sea is high.
Every day, the tide schedule shifts by 50 minutes (on average).
If we divide 24 hours and 50 minutes by four (number of tides per day), we get about 6 hours 12 minutes.
This is the average time at sea to climb or descend.
For a long time men have used the force of water that rises and descends.
Changes in the sea cause currents to move at the rate of tides.
These are tidal currents.
They can be very dangerous for navigation.
The movement of the sea makes it possible to use the force of the water.
As early as the 14th century, the Bretons built tidal mills.
These mills operated at low tide by releasing water held by a high tide wall.
The force of the water led to a wheel that produced energy such as the water mill on a river.
In 1961, men used the same principle to build the only tidal plant in France: the Rance factory.
Tidal water is used to operate turbines that produce electricity.
