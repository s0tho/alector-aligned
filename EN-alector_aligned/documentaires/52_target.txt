The beaver is a very good swimmer.
In the water, it can swim at a speed of ten kilometres an hour.
It is not cold because it has a fur with a lot of hair and a large layer of fat.
Its large lungs allow it to remain underwater for at least twenty minutes.
The beaver can cut trees very well, he is also very good at building dams.
When the beaver cuts a tree, he bites the trunk so that the upper and lower parts of the tree are separated by a very thin part.
When the parts are almost separated, the wind does the rest.
The beaver cuts the small branches, makes batteries and keeps them.
It separates the large branches and uses them to build dams.
