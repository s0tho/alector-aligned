Among all the dangers that threaten animals and plants, there is the danger of being eaten.
Some animals can camouflage while others hide.
Some of them are so fast, they can flee from their enemies.
Plants, which cannot escape, have developed other ways to protect themselves, and sharp stings and thorns are part of them.
Other plants as well as some animals protect themselves with poison that they can inject.
This poison is not necessarily deadly.
It is enough if it avoids them being eaten.
Some animals, like some flies, protect themselves by taking the appearance of poisonous animals.
In the animal world, a particularly visible colour usually indicates that the animal is not edible.
The wasp, for example, has yellow and black stripes.
