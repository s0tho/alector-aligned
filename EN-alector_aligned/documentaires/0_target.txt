Calming hunger seems to be the first goal of food.
But the real goal is to provide what's useful to the life of our 60 trillion cells.
The empty stomach makes noises.
Actually, the brain's giving the alarm.
It detects a lack of sugar in the blood and gives the desire to eat.
Tastes and smells calm the brain.
After twenty minutes, the stomach shows its pleasure by chemical and nervous signals.
The liver, the pancreas, and the intestine confirm the message: "I have eaten enough".
The body is ready to wait to taste it... especially if the meal can meet its needs.
Because of a menu: grated carrots-steak-p√¢tes-pain-camembert-apple, the body will have to draw from what to breathe, stay warm, grow, fight against microbes, play football or write a text.
Foods turn into liquid dough.
Then they are broken down into small pieces to cross the wall of the intestine.
When they're carried by blood, they're going to take their place in the body.
Carbohydrates (sugar pasta, bread, fruit) give energy.
Steak and cheese proteins make bones, skin, hair, cells, antibodies, hormones, etc.
Fats (fats of meat and camembert, carrot oil, pasta butter) ensure the work of the nervous, blood, hormonal and disease defense systems.
The body requires small doses of vitamins and minerals.
But the body does not know how to create them.
They must be found in food without being bothered by products such as dyes, pesticides, fried oil, alcohol or cigarette smoke.
The body is wise: it stores sugars and fatty bodies that it does not use immediately.
The rest disappears (the fibers of pasta, bread, carrots and apple). It is like a sponge that cleans toxic substances.
