It was a majestic tree.
It spread its branches in the middle of the jungle.
At the top, at the top, a bird had made its nest and soon chicks were born.
An elephant came to pass.
He liked to scratch his back: he approached the tree and began to rub vigorously against the trunk.
The whole tree moved and cracked.
In their nest, the chicks, terribly shaken, were caught in fear: they huddled near their mother.
"Oh! Grand Master of the jungle, there are enough trees around you! Don't shake this one.
My little children are afraid. They can fall from the nest and break their bones."
The elephant wouldn't answer.
He stared at the bird in his tiny eye, beat the air with his giant ears and left.
The next day he returned and grated more beautifully to the trunk of the tree.
The scared little birds once again huddled against the maternal wing.
The mother was very angry."I forbid you to shake this tree," she cried, "or I will punish you!
"You, a miserable creature of nothing at all!" ran the elephant. "What could you do against a colossus of my size?" If I wanted to, "I would throw that tree down and your nest at the same time!"
The mother bird answered nothing.
On the third day, the elephant returned to scratch against the trunk of the tree.
Fast as lightning, with one stroke of wing, the mother entered her immense ear.
Once she tickled him and scratched him with a paw.
The elephant had to shake his head, but nothing did.
Then he begged the bird to come out.
"I also asked you not to scare my little ones," the mother replied.
The elephant screamed, waved his trunk, ran like a madman through the jungle.
Finally, completely exhausted, it collapsed.
The bird then left the ear and returned to its nest with its children.
And never again did the elephant come back to this place to scratch his back.
