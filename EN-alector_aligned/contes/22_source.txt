Farmer Jean and his wife Mariette had no children and it made them very sad.
On a winter night, they saw something strange in the courtyard.
"Would it be a leprechaun?" asked Mariette, frightened.
The farmer who had approached, satisfied her with a laugh:
"He's just a snowman!"
The farmer approached her in turn.
"Look, John," she said, "it looks like some lost child, abandoned by his companions. He stopped outside our door, as if he wanted to seek refuge at home.
- Hey, Mariette, what's the matter with you?
Miracle, Jean, it's no longer a ball that serves as a head for the man! It's the figure of a child! He's opened his eyes... Here, now all his white coat has melted... Look, he's moving! He lives!
- It's true... a child, a boy... oh, he closes his eyes... hope he doesn't become a statue again.
- No, he only falls asleep. Here, take him in your arms, we'll carry him in the house."
The farmer entered and laid on an armchair, in front of the high chimney, the still asleep child. Mariette went to pick up a brace of branches which she threw on the embers. A flame came out. At the same moment, the boy woke up with a cry of terror. He jumped and ran away from the fire. The boy declared, designating the flame:
"The fire would make me disappear. There is only one way to warm me up, it is to love me. It is your love that made me live. I am the child of your love.
What are we going to call him, our snow child?" asked the farmer.
- If we called it Christmas... Christmas, isn't it a snow festival?" replied the man.
