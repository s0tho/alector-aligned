Dad's a bookstore.
He loves books.
He eats them.
He's an ogre.
He reads all day and sometimes even at night.
It's an incurable disease, but it doesn't seem to worry our family doctor.
Every night, a new pile of books arrives at home.
They're everywhere, right down to the bathroom.
It's an invasion.
It's impossible to scold.
With Dad, the invaders are always right.
He talks to them like humans.
He invents names for them and calls them my little books.
All the books are his friends.
I don't have a boyfriend.
And I don't like books.
From the outside, I look like Dad.
But inside, so here we are two strangers.
Mom pretends she doesn't know.
She loves us both.
I'm the smallest, but she doesn't even defend me when Dad wants to force me to read, do you realize?
The big holidays have just begun.
I don't know what to do.
So I'm helping Dad at the bookstore.
What am I doing?
He didn't allow me to tidy up and even touch anything.
I hear the paper doesn't stand up.
It's true that I like to hear the sound of a leaf tearing itself apart.
It's beautiful like a piece of music.
So I'm looking for the thieves.
It's the only thing that amuses me in a bookstore.
When a book disappears in the pocket of a pickpocket, I don't say anything, I'm way too happy.
One less invader, but that rarely happens.
In general, Dad detects thieves as they enter the store.
