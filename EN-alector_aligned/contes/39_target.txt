The flute player did not make himself say it twice.
He went out into the street and played a soft and strange music that attracted the attention of all the children of the city.
Some children stopped playing marelle or hunting in the alleys, quickly came out of their house, others stopped fighting or hunting at the stone-throwing whirlwinds...
As enchanted by music all, from the smallest to the largest, began to run behind the flutist.
The parents called their children but despite reminding them to order, scolding them, threatening them to be punished, the children never obeyed.
The flute player brought them out of town.
They arrived at the foot of a mountain. In the sides of this mountain a large door opened.
The flute player returned and all the children followed him.
Only a little boy was behind; indeed, he was drinking and could not walk as fast as the others.
But the door closed with a deadly noise.
When the poor parents, wretched and very worried, arrived at the scene, they found only the little boy in tears.
The parents of the missing children wept desperate.
The only child left in town was the poor lame, so sad that he could not play with his friends.
Life continued in Hamelin, but for many years it was the saddest city in Germany. The children were no longer there to cheer him up with their screams and laughter.
And every day, parents wept the memory of their cherished children.
