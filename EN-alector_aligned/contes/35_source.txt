The cat resumed its taste for life.
One day, the white mouse caught him training in front of a mirror.
First, he practiced slipping without the slightest noise near a screwdriver.
But one day the white mouse and two of her friends were sitting on bags of wheat at the top of the mill, having fun tearing up old newspapers, a terrible scream rang.
It was the furious miller that was thundering like this, holding his cat by the skin of his neck.
Despite the noise of the machinery and the wings of the mill, mice could hear what he was saying.
He exclaimed at the cat's address, since I bought you, there are more mice than ever! You don't serve anything and I'm going to put you in a big bag that I'll throw into the river tonight!
"Although we are sworn enemies," she murmured, "we don't want the miller to drown you. "If we help you run away, do you promise us to make peace with us?"
The bag nodded its head as a sign of acquiescence.
A group of mice led by their chief went to pick up from the coat rack the fur cap of the miller's wife.
They then brought the cape into the shed.
When they arrived other mice had already delivered the cat by eating the links that kept the bag closed.
Then they filled the fur cap with straw and hung on a horse iron to weigh the bag, which they closed.
The miller, now convinced that the cats were useless, did not buy any more.
But he didn't know that the big titty cat, happier than ever, was still living at the top of the mill with the mice, who brought him all kinds of treats stolen from the pantry of the house.
And they all spent their time playing together with the cat and the mouse...
