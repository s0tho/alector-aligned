On a holiday morning, Delphine and Marinette settled in the meadow with their boxes of paintings.
As they filled the buckets with clear water, the donkey came to them from the bottom of the meadow.
"Hello, little ones. What are you doing with these boxes?"
Marinette replied that they were preparing to paint and gave him all the explanations he wished for.
"If you want," she added, "I'll make your portrait.
"Oh, yes, I will," said the donkey. "We beasts have little opportunity to see each other as we are."
Marinette laid the profile donkey and began to paint. Having finished his portrait, the donkey was invited to come and see him and rushed. What he saw did not fail to surprise him.
"How bad we know each other," he said with a little melancholy. "I would never have thought I had a bulldog's head."
Marinette blushes and the donkey continued:
"It's like the ears, I've often been told that I've had them long, but to the point where they are, I wouldn't have thought so either."
The donkey continued to examine the painting with a rather grieving look. Suddenly, he was as if a burst and exclaimed:
"What does that mean? But I've only had two legs!"
This time, Marinette felt more comfortable and replied:
"Of course, I only saw you two legs. I couldn't do more.
- It's very nice, but I've got four legs.
- No, Delphine said. Profileally, you only have two legs."
The donkey didn't protest anymore.
"It's all right," he said, moving away, "I only have two legs."
Delphine laughed and Marinette laughed too, although she had a little remorse.
