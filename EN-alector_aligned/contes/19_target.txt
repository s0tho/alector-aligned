Jojo is a great collector.
What the kids of his age walk around in their pockets, the balls, the toys found in the surprise eggs, the little cars... He puts it away with care.
It keeps: sugars (enveloped), match boxes (empty), fossils, stamps, postcards, balls with snow in them, soaps, cans...
In every new collection, his father adds a shelf.
- Don't you think it's better to eat sardines before you keep the boxes?
Jojo never throws.
He keeps his old shoes, his pencils, his notebooks from last year.
Little by little, at home, the place is missing.
There are collections of Jojo everywhere.
In the living room, hallway, bathroom and cabinets.
- Jojo, we'll have to stop keeping items, or we'll have to separate ourselves from some of the collections.
Jojo is scared: it means selling... or throwing away!
I'll keep things very small.
Very small pebbles, sand, dust?
You're gonna need boxes to put all this away!
Words don't take place!
Even the longest is not very embarrassing.
The dictionaries that are on the landing, where do I put them?
Jojo is looking for something lighter, more unreal than words.
After one night to think, he finally finds.
I'll keep the time!
Aren't you going to bring us watches, alarm clocks... and clocks?
No, I'm going to keep the days.
Wednesday, March 10.
Wednesday 10 March. It must be very special, this Wednesday 10 March to be worthy of being guarded!
I'm gonna take a walk I've never done before.
I don't know these flowers, I'll take them and give them to my grandmother.
Today, March 10: I went for a walk.
The next day, Jojo managed to obtain a 10 out of 10 maths, for the first time in his life.
It's a day to mark with a white stone.
