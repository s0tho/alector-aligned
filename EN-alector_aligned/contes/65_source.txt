Ouoro was a beautiful chimpanzee who lived at the zoo.
Ouoro circled behind bars.
On a Sunday, he tried to open the door and shook it with all his strength.
The door was badly closed, it opened...
The monkey jumped out of his cage.
He followed the aisle of the trees.
Suddenly, he saw a black car stopping close to him.
A man went down and gave him his hand. The monkey let himself be driven to the black car that started and rolled for a long time.
Finally the car arrived: there was a fair in the square and a small circus.
The man brought down Ouoro and passed a chain around his neck.
"I'll teach him how to swell the balloons and make him a niche in the yard," said the man.
In a workshop, the man inflated the multicoloured balloons he sold the next day at the fair.
Often, at the vigil, Ouoro helped his new master. At night, the monkey slept in the workshop, he was not chained.
He could not escape: how could he have climbed those huge walls that closed the courtyard?
And one day, he had an idea, and all night, he swung balloons.
When they were round, he took great care to ligature them with a solid string.
In the morning, he had a hundred balloons ready to fly.
Ouoro, who was looking for time, joyfully saw a nice wind rise that shook the trees.
Carefully, he dragged all these balloons through the string.
Then, fastening the ropes, clinging his feet and hands, he let the balloons go to the wind. Ouoro climbed, climbed into the air.
Soon he was carried higher than the wall of the court.
