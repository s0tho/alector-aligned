Jojo is a great collector.
What the children of his age trot in their pockets, the balls, the toys found in the surprise eggs, the little cars... He carefully puts it away.
It collects: sugars (enveloped), match boxes (empty), fossils, stamps, postcards, balls with snow in them, soaps, cans...
In every new collection, his father adds a shelf.
- Don't you think it's better to eat the sardines before you store the boxes?
Jojo never throws.
He keeps his old shoes, his pencils, his notebooks from last year.
Little by little, at home, the place is missing.
There are collections of Jojo everywhere.
In the living room, hallway, bathroom and cabinets.
- Jojo, we'll have to stop accumulating items... or we'll have to separate ourselves from some of the collections.
Jojo is horrified: it means selling... or throwing away!
I'm going to collect very small things.
Very small pebbles, sand, dust?
You're gonna need boxes to put all this away!
Words don't take place!
Even the longest, unconstitutionally unconstitutional, is not very cumbersome.
The dictionaries that are on the landing, where do I put them?
Jojo is looking for something lighter, more unreal than words.
After a night of reflection, he finally finds out.
I'll collect the time!
Aren't you going to bring us watches, alarm clocks... and clocks?
No, I'm going to collect the days.
Wednesday, March 10.
Wednesday 10 March. It must be very special, this Wednesday 10 March to be worthy to be collected!
I'm gonna take a walk I've never done before.
I don't know these flowers, I'll pick them up and give them to my grandmother.
Today, March 10: I went for a walk in the back.
The next day, Jojo managed to obtain a 10 out of 10 maths, for the first time in his life.
It's a day to mark with a white stone.
