Thursday, after lunch, as I had a little more time before I found the buddies in the open ground, I sat in the chair, and I took the paper that Dad had left there before leaving at work.
As usual, apart from photos and drawings, there was nothing to read in the paper, except on the last page, and there was something great!
There was a big contest, and the first prize was a car!
We saw the picture of the car, and it was a cool car like everything.
For the contest, they said that every day they were going to pass a picture of a monument, and that we had to recognize it and tell where it was.
It was funnyly easy; they gave an example, and I immediately saw that it was the Eiffel Tower, the one in Paris.
I am very strong for monuments and I know a lot of them: there is the statue of Jean-Jules Tremp√© (1864-1930), with a beard and pigeons, near the school, in the square, and then that of Poirier-Lamarre, who was a corsair, and who is in Bains-les-Mers, not far from the Beau-Rivage hotel, where we spent a holiday with Dad and Mom, and who we see from the dining room, leaning, and it's a nice iron statue, looking through a long view at the beach hotel and in the contest they will surely talk about it.
