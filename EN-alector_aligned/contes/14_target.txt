Mr. Dursley and Mrs. Dursley lived on Privet Drive, and they had always proudly said they were normal, thank you for them.
No one would have imagined that they could find themselves in something strange or mysterious.
They didn't have any time to lose with cornets.
Mr. Dursley was running a tool-making company.
He was a big and massive man, who had almost no neck. He had a mustache of beautiful size.
Madame Dursley was thin and blonde and had a neck twice as long as average, which was very useful to her. She was spying on her neighbors through the fences of the gardens.
The Dursleys had a little boy, his name was Dudley, and for them he was the most beautiful child in the world.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted.
The only terrible thing they had was a secret, they were afraid we'd find out one day.
If anyone ever heard of the Potters, they were convinced they wouldn't make it.
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but both had not seen each other in years.
In fact, Madame Dursley acted as if she were an only daughter, because her sister and husband were as far away as possible from everything that made a Dursley.
The Dursleys trembled with fear as to what the neighbors would say if the Potters came to their streets.
They knew the Potters, too, had a little boy, but they had never seen him.
His existence was one more reason to keep the Potters away: there was no question that little Dudley would start dating a child like that.
