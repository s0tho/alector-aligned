Placed on the top of a dead tree, the raven looked and dreamed of the dark building in front of him.
He was thinking about the occupants of the premises.
In Brunoît, the king who no longer had a throne, in Nevé, his wife, and in Mara, their daughter... three innocent people condemned to live locked up here, in Castelbrune, forever.
In a moment, he would change forever the existence of one of them.
The bird knew their terrible story by heart. She had been told several times.
It all began 14 years earlier, when at the palace the king, loving the study of medicinal plants, read an old book in his workshop.
Nour, his greatest sister, had arrived, panicked:
"Come quickly, Angus is burning with fever and cannot rise."
Nour, a widow for a long time, loved his son very much, always fearing that he would be unhappy. The king had returned to the bedside of Angus, which his good teacher kept.
The king had examined it before saying with a smile:
– It's just a bad flu. I'm going to prepare a cure very quickly that will bring down his fever.
Shortly afterwards, the patient had drunk a trait of the smelly herbal tea prepared by Brunoît.
Unfortunately, he had been taken from violent tremors and, under the helpless eyes of adults, he died.
In the evening, the court doctor said:
– Angus was suffering from a simple flu, but this is not the cause of his death...
Then he coughed, uncomfortable, before saying:
– He died after taking his herbal tea and also a poison, probably cyanide.
Easy then to accuse the king of murder; the mother of Angus did so immediately by throwing herself on her brother.
- The tea... the cyanide... you're the one who killed! You're... you're a monster!
The king, surprised, protested forcefully:
"How can you imagine such a thing? You have to be reasonable, you know that for nothing in the world I would not have done harm to Angus."
But Nour's anger, certain of being in the presence of the culprit, had not calmed down.
