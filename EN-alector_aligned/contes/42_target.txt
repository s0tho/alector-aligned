Once upon a time he was a very poor logger, and he could no longer feed his seven children.
One night, he said to his wife:
- Tomorrow I'll lose them in the forest.
The smallest of the 7 children, called Petit Poucet, had heard everything.
He put white pebbles in his pockets.
The next day, the children found themselves alone in the forest, but the Petit Poucet threw stones on the way. He managed to bring everyone home.
Several days later, the father still lost his children in the forest, but the Petit Poucet had not thrown stones to be able to return home.
Were they really lost?
The children walked until they reached a castle. In the castle lived an ogre with his 7 daughters.
The ogre asked the boys to stay in his castle and he thought he'd eat them the next day.
The little girls slept together in a big bed with gold crowns on their heads.
While the children and the ogre slept, the Little Poucet took the crowns of the daughters and put them on the heads of his brothers.
When the ogre went to eat the boys, touching their heads, he felt the crowns.
He went into the second room and felt no crown, and ate his daughters.
The next morning the boys succeeded from the castle and the Petit Poucet took the boots of 7 leagues of the ogre.
With the boots they quickly found their home.
The kings, who lived next door, asked them to carry their important letters. The little Poucet received a lot of money and became very rich.
His family was happy thanks to him.
