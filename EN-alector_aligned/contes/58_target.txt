We repeat our play several times. At first, it's a mess, then, little by little, everything gets put in place.
Finally, on a Thursday, the mistress said:
- Tomorrow, we'll go to the party room for our last rehearsal.
Friday rehearsal goes well to the big scene of the fight.
We're three Musketeers against 15 enemies.
After five minutes, we have to call:
- D'Artagnan, help!
But when Tim arrives, there's a big silence.
It remains planted, the sword ahead, mute like a carp.
Everybody's starting to laugh.
Tim's looking for his words:
I don't know what to say anymore.
Lo√Øc takes Tim by the arm and says:
- I knew you'd miss it!
Luckily, the mistress cuts him:
It's all right, rehearsals are for that.
Everybody in place, let's go back!
This time, on entering, Tim shouts:
I'm coming, one for one and all for all!
Now he stops, panicked, too late, the whole class laughs again.
Tim lowers his head, but we still see that he's red like a tomato.
