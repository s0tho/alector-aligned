One morning, Delphine and Marinette put their paint boxes in the meadow.
They filled glasses with water when the donkey came to them from the bottom of the meadow.
"Hello, little ones. What are you doing with these boxes?"
Marinette said to him, "We're getting ready to paint. Marinette gave him all the explanations.
"If you want, I'll make your portrait.
"Oh, yes, I will," said the donkey. "We beasts have little opportunity to see each other as we are."
Marinette put the donkey aside and began to paint. With the finished portrait, she invited the donkey to come and see him. The donkey was very surprised by the portrait he saw.
"How bad we know each other," he said with a little grief. "I would never have thought I had a dog's head."
The donkey continued:
"My ears were often told that they were long. I didn't think it was so long."
The donkey looked at the painting again with a sad look. Suddenly, he leaped and exclaimed:
"What does that mean? But I've only had two legs!"
So Marinette felt better and said,
"Of course, I only saw you two legs. I couldn't do more.
- It's very nice, but I've got four legs.
"No," said Delphine. "On the side, you only have two legs."
The donkey no longer grudged, he was upset.
"It's okay," he said when he left, "I only have two legs."
Delphine laughed, and Marinette laughed, but she regretted.
