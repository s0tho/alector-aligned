Once upon a time a little girl named Sophie lived with her grandpa forever.
One day his grandpa went into his attic and took a box. The box had plenty of memories of his life: an old letter, a box of matches with secret writings, old coins that Sophie had never seen, a pink ribbon that the grandpa kissed in silence, a black and white picture of a little boy with curly hair... and so many other treasures.
At one point, the grandpa puts his hand in a bunch of postcards, searches the bottom of the box and pulls out his closed hand.
He opens his hand and shows Sophie a golden nugget that shines.
- "My little Sophie, this nugget is the seed of a magical tree. You must plant it in the earth, in a place in the garden that you love, with lots of sun and no wind...
- Oooooh, cut Sophie, a magic tree, what kind of magic are you talking about, Grandpa?
- You will know if you take care of this seed. This seed will be a tree and you will see its secret! Now go, little one."
