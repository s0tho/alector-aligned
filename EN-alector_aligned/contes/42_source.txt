Once upon a time he was such a poor logger that he no longer knew how to feed his seven children.
One night, he said to his wife:
- Tomorrow I'll leave them in the forest.
But the youngest of the seven boys, called Petit Poucet, had heard everything.
He went to fill his pockets with white pebbles.
The next day, the children found themselves alone in the forest; but the Petit Poucet, who had sown the pebbles along the way, brought his brothers back to their parents.
A few days later, the unfortunate logger lost them again, but this time the Petit Poucet had not been able to make provision for stones to return to his path.
Were they really lost?
They walked and arrived in front of a large castle inhabited by an ogre who had seven daughters.
The ogre allowed the boys to sleep at home, thinking he'd eat them in the early morning.
The seven daughters of the ogre all slept in a large bed, a golden crown on the head.
During the night, the Petit Poucet removed the crowns from the girls' heads and placed them on that of the boys who also slept in a large bed.
Why did Pouce do this? When the ogre wanted to eat the boys, he felt the crowns.
He went to the other room and, feeling nothing on his heads, he ate his daughters.
In the morning, the seven boys managed to get out of the castle and the Petit Poucet took the boots of seven leagues of the ogre.
So they soon found their parents.
Charged by the neighboring kings to carry their important letters very quickly, the Petit Poucet soon became very rich.
Thanks to him, his family was finally happy.
