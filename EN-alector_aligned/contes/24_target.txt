All the beasts of the bush came together, saying they were going to make a big box for the rain.
But the hare refused to come, saying that he was sick, every time he was called.
When the box was finished, the rain began to fall 3 days later.
The hare came very quickly to shelter itself in the box. The other animals brought him out, angry.
So the hare remained outside in the rain. The sun returned and all the animals went into the bush to feed themselves.
The hare found a very large flute.
Five days later, the rain fell.
The hare came running and entered the first box with its instrument.
He looked for a place to hide, and the other animals entered in their turn.
When all were there, the hare began to play the flute forcefully, which scared the animals that went away by shaking themselves.
Outside, they stopped and asked, "What was in the box? I don't know, I don't know," the animals replied.
The elephant then ordered the oulard (bird with long legs, a long neck and a short beak, who lives in Africa) to go and see.
When the sea urchin arrived, the hare played the flute with rage. The sea urchin, saving himself, said that the terrible thing was always in the box.
The elephant then had the idea of sending the cat which, without noise, could arrive at the hut. Without warning he would see what was in it.
The cat hid at the door and heard the noise again, the hare always playing. "No way back," said the cat. "The dangerous thing always makes noise."
The elephant then sent the hyena.
When she arrived at the box, she heard noise and escaped before arriving at the door:
"- I entered the box, the thing wanted to give me a shot. I ran away, she chased me, but she couldn't catch me. Anyway, anyway, I'm healthy and safe and here I am.
"So," said the elephant, "you have to give up the box. Let's not go."
From that day on, the animals left the box. The hare made it its refuge for the rainy days.
