Once upon a time there was a man and a woman who had seven children, all boys.
The great was only 10 years old and the youngest 7.
Surprisingly, the man had so many children in such a short time; but his wife went fast and had two children at the same time.
They were very poor, and their 7 children tired them very much, because none could work.
What made them sad was that the youngest one was very sensitive and didn't talk. They thought he was stupid when he was good.
When he was born, he was no bigger than the thumb, which is why he was called the little Poucet.
That poor child was the victim of the house, and he was always wronged.
But he was the most fine and wiser of all his brothers. He spoke little, he listened a lot.
A very difficult year came when famine was so great that these poor people decided to abandon their children.
One evening that the children slept and the man was by the fire with his wife, he said, sadly,
"You see that we can no longer feed our children; I do not want them to starve in front of my eyes. I will lose them tomorrow in the woods, which will be easy. They will have fun, we will leave without them seeing us."
"Ah!" cried the woman, "would you be able to abandon your children?"
