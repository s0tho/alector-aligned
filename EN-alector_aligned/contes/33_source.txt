Once upon a time there was a logger and a logger who had seven children, all boys.
The eldest was only ten years old and the youngest was only seven.
It is astonished that the logger had so many children in such a short time; but it was that his wife quickly went to work, and did not less than two at a time.
They were very poor, and their seven children bothered them a lot, because none of them could yet earn a living.
What still saddened them was that the youngest was very delicate and did not say a word: taking for nonsense what was a mark of the goodness of his mind.
He was very small, and when he came into the world, he was not much bigger than the thumb, which made him known as the little Poucet.
This poor child was the pain and suffering of the house, and he was always wronged.
Yet he was the most fine, and the most wise of all his brothers, and if he spoke little, he listened much.
It came a very unfortunate year and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to get rid of their children.
One evening that the children were lying down, and that the logger was by the fire with his wife, he said to him, with a heart filled with pain:
"You see that we can't feed our children anymore; I can't see them starving in front of my eyes, and I'm determined to go and lose them tomorrow in the woods, which will be very easy, for while they're having fun, we'll only have to run away without them seeing us."
"Ah!" cried the logger, "could you lead yourself to lose your children?"
