Once upon a time, two peasants lived in a village on Mount Lebanon.
They had a small field of fertile land.
The husband cultivated wheat and corn there.
Around their house, the man planted three olive trees and two orange trees.
With the olives, he made oil for their personal use. When the harvest was very good, he sold oil to his neighbors.
When the orange trees began to bloom, the woman rose very early to pick up the flowers still in button.
She stopped picking when the sun was too strong or the bees were too numerous.
She then opened the buttons to take the petals with which she made orange blossom water. She sold this water to the market.
This peasant couple had a single daughter who was of marriageable age.
Her name was Warda.
She had long black hair and almond eyes.
All the young men in the village wanted to marry her.
But the mother told all the boys that only one who would give a unique gift to the world to his daughter would have his hand.
Boys didn't know what to do.
Some gave their donkeys, others their dromedary. The mother shook her shoulders and smiled.
- Asses and dromedaries can be found everywhere, she told them.
You have to give my daughter a gift unique to the world.
Warda married the boy she had chosen, and they lived happily.
The whole village found that Warda had made the right choice.
She had decided to take as the most generous husband of the boys.
