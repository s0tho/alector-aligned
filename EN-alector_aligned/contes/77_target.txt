Not so long ago, a noble taxi driver named Ebenezer Jones was going to his home.
By the time he was crossing a neighborhood in London, the weather was stormy.
He rode in the middle of a vague terrain and suddenly appeared to him a dark object, quite large and placed vertically.
This object, smaller than a coal bucket but larger than a small bottle of cider, moved slowly across the road.
Jones had approached this object up to 20 metres, when a biker left it in real madness by holding it very close.
Jones braked abruptly by taking a look in the mirror.
When he looked again, he saw that the rider must have spilled this object that was now standing on the side, right in front of his wheels.
He stopped his taxi quickly.
"I might be crazy," he said.
There are funny people in this neighborhood, so don't get involved.
But when it's such a thing, you have to stop to realize.
" He descended from his car, and a large bird lay on the road, sixty centimetres long with a hairy fringe around the beak.
Jones thought he was dead.
He approached him and saw that he opened an eye and then closed him.
"Poor old man," he thought.
In the "Diary of the Drivers", Jones had consulted his horoscope: "Today, thanks to your skill, there will be a life saved."
On his way home, he was concerned about this omen, saying that to his knowledge he had not saved any life all day, except by avoiding pedestrians who crossed without looking.
"This will be the life I have to save," he said. "It must be that since it's midnight minus five."
And he went into the cab to take the bottle of cognac and teaspoon he always kept in the tool kit in case someone was sick.
