In a small town, a fruit merchant owned a store just above a deep cellar.
Every night the mice came in crowds from that cellar in the store.
They ate apples and pears, grapes and nuts, and did not save vegetables and potatoes either.
Between midnight and sunrise, no goods in the store were spared from the small rodents.
At night, as long as there was noise in the streets and wagons rolling, the mice remained silent in the cellar.
But as early as midnight, they came in crowds, had fun with sweet fruits and celebrated real banquets.
Their traces of passage despaired the store.
He was trying in vain to protect himself from mice.
