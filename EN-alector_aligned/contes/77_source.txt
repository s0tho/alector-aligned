Not so long ago, an honourable taxi driver named Ebenezer Jones returned to his home at a late hour.
By the time he was crossing a London neighborhood, the weather was storming.
And, as he was driving in the middle of a vague terrain, suddenly appeared to him a dark object, quite considerable and placed vertically.
This object, smaller than a coal bucket but larger than a small bottle of cider, moved slowly across the road.
Ebenezer had approached this object up to 20 metres, when a biker broke it up as a real pain in the neck by tightening it very closely.
Mr. Jones braked abruptly by taking a look in the mirror.
When he looked again, he realized that the rider had to have overturned that object that was now standing on the side, right in front of his wheels.
He stopped his cab immediately.
"I might be a bit crazy," he said.
There are funny people in this neighborhood, so don't get involved.
But when it's such a thing, you have to stop to realize.
" He descended from his car, and a large bird lay on the road, sixty centimetres long with a hairy fringe around the beak.
Ebenezer first felt like he was dead.
But as he was getting closer to him, he saw that he was troubling an eye and closing it.
"Poor old man," he thought.
In the "Journal of Conductors", Ebenezer had consulted his horoscope: "Today, thanks to your skill, there will be a life saved."
On his way home, he had bothered himself because of this prediction, thinking that to his knowledge he had not saved any life all day, except by avoiding pedestrians who crossed without looking.
"This will be the life I have to save," he said. "It must be that since it's midnight minus five."
And he took the inside of the taxi to take the bottle of cognac and the teaspoon that he always kept in the tool kit in case a lady or something passed out.
