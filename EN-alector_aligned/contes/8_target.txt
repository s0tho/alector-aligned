"Water has fallen again," Folco thought.
The young boy felt under his feet his old worn boat scraping the vase.
It was the difficult passage between the mud islands.
Folco knew all the water paths of his Camargue marsh.
This marsh was his beautiful estate.
Often, in the evening, as today, all alone on the barquet (small boat) of grandfather Eusebio, Folco set out to discover, like a prince who visited his kingdom.
This huge country of blue sky and calm waters, it was his, Folco.
The boy was tall and muscular for his 12th birthday.
Folco, standing at the back of his boat, with bare feet tied against the edge, had planted his pole (long wooden rod on which one leans to advance the boat in the shallow waters) in the vase.
He passed his fingers through his hair, sticking to his face, full of sweat.
Then, leaning on his pole, he pushed forcefully to move the boat forward.
The barquet finally came out of this sea of rushes (plant with a long, straight and flexible stem).
The boat was now gliding noiselessly on grey water; Folco was happy.
He will grow to the bottom of the marsh, to the great lands that attracted the young boy.
There, wild horses lived freely in the midst of their pastures.
Folco, sometimes, saw them. Horses galloped, mane in the wind, in a cloud of sand and sun.
Folco dreamed of these beautiful horses.
Grandpa Eusebio would have wanted his grandson to be a fisherman, just like him.
But no, Folco wouldn't be a fisherman.
Later he would be guardian (guardian of herds of bulls and horses in Camargue).
There's no better job than that of gardian.
We're riding all day.
We gallop in search of manades (beast troupels in the Camargue) of black bulls...
We capture and tame wild horses.
