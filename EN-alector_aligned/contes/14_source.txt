Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who lived at the 4th Privet Drive, had always said with the greatest pride that they were perfectly normal, thank you for them.
Never would anyone have imagined that they could be involved in anything strange or mysterious.
They didn't have any time to lose with cornets.
Mr. Dursley ran the Grunnings, a company that made drills.
He was a large and massive man, who had practically no neck, but on the other hand had a beautiful mustache.
Dursley, on the other hand, was thin and blonde and had a neck twice as long as average, which was very useful for spying on her neighbors looking over the fences of the gardens.
The Dursleys had a little boy named Dudley and he was in their eyes the most beautiful child in the world.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted.
The only undesirable thing they had was a secret they feared more than anything we ever discovered.
If anyone ever heard of the Potters, they were convinced they wouldn't get over it.
Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but both had not seen each other in years.
In fact, Mrs. Dursley was acting as if she was a single daughter, because her sister and her husband's no-go-to-do were as far away as possible from anything that made a Dursley.
The Dursleys trembled with fear at the thought of what the neighbors would say if unfortunately the Potters showed up on their streets.
They knew the Potters, too, had a little boy, but they had never seen him.
His existence was an additional reason to keep the Potters away: there was no question that little Dudley would start dating a child like that.
