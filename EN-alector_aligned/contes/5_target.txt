Dad's name is Damien, Damien Bouscau, just like me.
Mom's name is Stéphanette.
Dad, he's still laughing.
He's a nice guy.
Even though I'm only 10 years old, he's taking me to team up with him on the esplanade of Fort Saint John.
I point; he shoots.
It blows the plug 10 meters away.
I'm playing belot with Grandma Za.
As she cheats, I scream and she gives me a towel.
I don't know how she does it, she still has a towel with her, like a cowboy has his gun.
One day, if there's a towel race at the Olympic Games, it's sure that Grandma Za will have the gold medal.
She never misses her goal, even when she throws the towel through the kitchen.
He's leaving and he's opening up like a wing, and paf!
The towel lands in your face.
Grandma Marie-Louise, with the tea towels, wipes the dishes.
Sometimes, Grandma Marie-Louise wipes her eyes when she lost at the lottery.
To comfort her, I said, "Come on, let's make another lottery."
She's kissing me.
I like her, she's sweet.
She doesn't have a husband. I think he died, too, as a father Baptistin, but I don't know what to do.
We never talk about him.
But Grandma Marie-Louise has to think about him and it makes her sad.
We all live together on 10 rue des Mauvestis.
Mauvestis is an old word that means "the ill-dressed." But we are well dressed, without a hole, every five, and we have television.
Mémé Za and Grandma Marie-Louise lie in the same room where there is a double bed.
Mom and Dad are sleeping in the blue room.
And I'm sleeping on the couch in the dining room.
In the evening, the whole family is sitting on the couch watching TV.
When it's a cowboy movie, I stay awake, but I fall asleep for singers and love movies.
Then I slip behind them.
I lie down, I have four backs that hide from me the television. The back of Grandma Za is a terrible shadow.
I don't see anything anymore and I fall asleep.
