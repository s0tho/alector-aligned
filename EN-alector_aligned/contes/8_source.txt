"Water has fallen again," Folco thought.
The young boy felt under his feet his old, rotten boat scraping the bottom of the vase.
It was the bad passage between the mud islands.
Folco knew all the water paths of his Camargue marsh.
This marsh was his wonderful estate.
Often, in the evening, as today, he set out to discover, alone on the barquet (small boat) of grandfather Eusebio, like a prince who visited his kingdom.
This huge country of blue sky and calm waters, it was his, Folco.
The boy was tall and muscular for his 12th birthday.
Standing at the back of his boat, with bare feet well fixed against the edge of boards, Folco had firmly planted his pole (long wooden rod on which one leans to advance the boat in the shallow waters) in the vase.
He passed his fingers through that brush of hair that stuck to his face, all wet with sweat.
Then, arched on his pole, he weighed with all his strength to move the boat forward.
The barquet finally emerged from this tide of rushes (plant with a long, straight and flexible stem).
He was now gliding noiselessly on the gray wave; Folco was happy.
He was going to grow to the bottom of the marsh, to the great lands that attracted the young boy.
There, in the midst of their pastures, the troops of wild horses lived freely.
Folco, sometimes, saw them galloping mane in the wind, in a cloud of sand and sun.
Folco dreamed of these wonderful horses.
Grandpa Eusebio would have wanted his grandson to be a fisherman, just like him.
But no, Folco wouldn't be a fisherman.
Later he would be guardian (guardian of herds of bulls and horses in Camargue).
There's no better job than that of gardian.
We're riding all day.
We gallop in search of manades (beast troupels in the Camargue) of black bulls...
We capture and tame wild horses.
