On the square of a village in southern India, there was a huge tree.
Don't imagine a tree 100 meters high.
This tree has only 2 branches... 2 beautiful branches, like 2 open arms, like an invitation to life.
At the foot of the tree there are gifts of all kinds: flowers, sweets, strange objects... to thank him for the vows granted.
On these two branches, the tree gives beautiful fruits, big as papayas, golden as mangoes, juicy as pineapples.
One branch gives life, the other gives death.
Right or left?
Now, the villagers have forgotten on which side are the good fruits and on which side are the poisoned fruits...
That year, a dry spring, followed by a hot summer dry the earth.
The area is becoming very dry.
Drought brings famine.
The villagers are hungry.
Only the tree on the village square remains the same. It keeps as much fruit on its 2 branches as on stars in the sky.
The villagers have multiplied their prayers and offerings.
No one dares to choose a fruit on one of the two branches, for fear of losing their lives.
Yet a brave and strong young man will take the risk, to help his friends.
The whole village is in a circle around it.
It goes towards the tree, towards the branch to the right.
He chooses a fruit, closes his eyes, door to his mouth.
The fruit is good.
Immediately the villagers run to the tree and eat these good fruits. As by magic the fruits repel, as soon as they are picked.
Then the villagers began to look at the left branch with a defiant air, a threatening air.
They end up thinking that this branch is bad... you have to take it off.
The decision is taken together.
The villagers, angry, saw the branch at the bottom of the trunk.
The tree, deprived of one of its branches, offers more to the morning sun than damaged leaves.
The birds are running away from him.
The bark dries.
The tree is dead.
