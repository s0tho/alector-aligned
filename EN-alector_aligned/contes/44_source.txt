The wind blows on your face and in your hair.
It moves the leaves of the trees, the grass of the fields, the waves on the sea and the clouds in the sky.
You can feel it, but you can't see it.
He's invisible.
You can also hear him yelling when he blows very loudly.
The wind is the air set in motion by different causes.
Its strength can range from the agitation of a fan to violent winds. Winds are created by the differences in warming of continents and oceans due to the sun.
Sometimes the wind is quite regular, it is the little breeze that comes from the sea.
It can be violent and blow in a storm.
Sometimes it arrives in gusts.
Sometimes it's surprising: it changes direction abruptly. The dead leaves then fly in whirlwinds.
A layer of air called the atmosphere surrounds the earth.
This air contains two gases: nitrogen and oxygen, and a small amount of other gases.
By heating, the gases expand, they become lighter and rise.
Thus, the air heated by the sun rises. A vacuum is created then that aspirates the cold.
That's what causes the wind.
Since the highest antiquity, men have used the force of the wind.
They used the wind that swells the sails of the ships to navigate the sea.
For thousands of years, this energy has allowed the transport of men and goods and the discovery of unknown land.
