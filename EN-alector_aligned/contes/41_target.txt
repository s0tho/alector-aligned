Once upon a time there was a little village girl, the prettiest. Her mother loved her very much, and her grandmother even more.
His grandmother had made him make a little red chaperon, which was so well suited to him, that everywhere he was called the little Red Chaperon.
One day, his mother, who had made cakes, said to him:
I've been told she's sick, carry her a cake and this little pot of butter.
Little Red Chaperon left to go to his grandmother's house who lived in another village.
By passing through a wood, she met the Wolf. He wanted to eat it; but he dared not, because there were some men who were in the forest.
The wolf asked her where she was going. The child, who did not know it was dangerous to stop listening to a wolf, said to her:
- I'm going to see my grandma, and I'm going to bring her a cake with a little pot of butter.
- Does she live far away?
"Oh, yes," said the little Red Chaperon, "it's after the mill that you see all over there, over there, at the first house of the village.
"Well," said the Wolf, "I want to go see him too; I take this way, and you take the other way. We will see who will arrive first.
