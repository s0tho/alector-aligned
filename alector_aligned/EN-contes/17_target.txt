That night Hugo slept well at the bottom of his apple, when suddenly the fruit was shaken.
What a storm!
Hugo, who didn't have time to get out of his bed, fell crying out of fear: "Help! Help!"
Outside, trouble sowers enjoyed themselves.
The apple moved and finally fell at the foot of the tree.
Hugo, who had not hurt himself, was furious in the middle of his house in pieces.
What a trouble!
- Look, Mireille laughs, he's naked now... naked like a worm!
- Naked like a worm! shouted his friends laughing.
Unfortunately, our worm didn't understand the joke.
He never spent the night outside. He was very worried.
Then he slipped into a cabbage.
It was the house of a very chatty big slug, her name was Grace.
- Oh, my God, what you're white, here, eat some cabbage, it's good for your health.
- Thanks, but I...
Ta-ta-ta, eat some, eat some, you're so skinny.
- I still prefer to bite in apples, says the ass loud enough.
- Ta-ta-ta, again. I insist. And don't speak full mouth, little cabbage, it's very badly raised, she says.
