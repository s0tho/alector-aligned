Dad's a bookstore.
He loves books.
He eats them.
He's an ogre.
He reads all day and sometimes at night.
It's an incurable disease, but it doesn't seem to worry our family doctor.
Every night, a new pile of books arrives at home.
They're everywhere, right down to the bathroom.
It's an invasion.
It's impossible to scold.
With Dad, the occupants are always right.
He talks to them like humans.
He invents names for them and calls them my little books.
All the books are his friends.
I don't have a boyfriend.
And I don't like books.
From the outside, I'm like Dad.
But inside we are two strangers.
Mom pretends not to see him.
She loves us both.
I'm the smallest, but she doesn't defend me when Dad wants to force me to read.
Great vacations have begun.
I don't know what to do.
So I'm helping Dad at the bookstore.
What am I doing?
He didn't allow me to tidy up and touch anything.
I hear the paper doesn't stand up.
It's true that I like to hear the sound of a leaf tearing itself apart.
It's beautiful like a piece of music.
So I'm watching the thieves.
It's the only thing that amuses me in a bookstore.
When a book goes into a thief's pocket, I don't say anything, I'm way too happy.
One less occupier, but that doesn't happen very much.
In general, Dad finds the thieves when they arrive in the store.
