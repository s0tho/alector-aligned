In Tango, there was a village called Mizuno√©.
In this village lived a fisherman. His name was Urashima Taro.
He was a wise man, with a sensitive and good heart. Taro had never done or wanted to hurt anyone.
Taro came back one night from fishing.
As he had fished a lot, he came home happy.
On the shore, Taro saw a bunch of little boys, and they seemed happy to torment a little turtle on the sand.
Taro didn't like to be bothered by animals.
He felt sorry for the turtle.
Taro approached the children, and spoke with a loud voice:
"What harm has this beast done to you," he said, "to torment it so? The gods punish the children who torment the animals."
- Mind your own business, says the oldest child of the troupe. This turtle is nobody's. We are free to kill her if it pleases us. You have nothing to do with it.
The fisherman understands that no explanation will have any hold on these hearts without mercy. He changes tactics and, in a softer tone:
I didn't mean to scold you. I wanted to offer you a deal. Do you want to sell me this turtle? I'll give you 20 sous. Is that okay?
20 bucks!
It's a fortune for these kids.
They say yes without hesitation. Taro gives them two small pieces. They run to the village to buy cakes.
The fisherman remained alone with the turtle he saved. He lifts her up in his hands, caressing her, and says:
The proverb gives you 10,000 years of life, but it only gives 1,000 to the stork. What would you have become without me? I think your 10,000 years would have been shorter! They were going to kill you, these thugs!... Come on, I'm going to give you freedom. But in the future, be careful, and above all, never fall back into the hands of the children.
