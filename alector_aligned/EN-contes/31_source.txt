The elephant barred to greet another elephant, to remind his little one to order, to manifest his fear or anger. These barrages resonate throughout the bush...
However, this is not the only way to communicate orally.
Let us follow a group of elephants that progresses in the savannah, in small groups spaced, on a front of several kilometers.
Suddenly the troop stopped, changed direction or speed.
But why do elephants have such a strange attitude?
If you were at that time, in the middle of the elephant troupe, you would have felt a strange impression, a kind of deaf rumbling, something that looks like the distant rumbling of a plane very high in the sky.
The human ear doesn't really hear it, and yet, one perceives "in the bottom of the air" something very deaf.
This very serious sound is the other voice of the elephants.
They emit infrasounds: very serious sounds that men normally don't hear, but that can be recorded very well with specialized devices.
The infrasounds are very far away because they are not altered by distance.
Several kilometres apart, elephant troops can alert themselves to the presence of a water point, the fatigue of one of the young, or the existence of a danger, such as an earthquake or tsunami.
To better hear these signals, elephants all stop at the same time, with their ears stretched for almost a minute.
Once the message is heard, they stop, change direction or accelerate their progress.
Elephants first communicate through sounds or vocalizations known as rumblings.
These rumblings contain fundamental frequencies in the infrasonore domain.
These frequencies cannot be heard by humans, even if their harmonics are audible.
