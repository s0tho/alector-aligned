Dad's name is Damien, Damien Bouscau, just like me.
Mom's name is Stéphanette.
Dad, he's still laughing.
He's a nice guy.
Even though I'm only 10 years old, he takes me to the esplanade of Fort Saint-Jean, to team up with him, with balls.
I point; he shoots.
It blows the plug ten meters away.
I'm playing belot with Grandma Za.
As she cheats, I scream and she blows me with a towel.
I don't know how she does it, she always has a towel with her, like a cowboy has his gun.
If, one day, there's a towel race at the Olympic Games, sure that Grandma Za has the gold medal.
She never misses her goal, even when she throws the towel through the kitchen.
He's leaving and he's opening up like a wing, and paf!
He lands you in the face.
Grandma Marie-Louise, with the tea towels, wipes the dishes.
Sometimes she wipes her eyes when she loses at the lottery.
To comfort her, I said, "Come on, let's make another one."
She's kissing me.
I like her, she's sweet.
She doesn't have a husband, I think he died, too, as a father of Baptistin, but I don't know what.
We never talk about him.
There's only Grandma Marie-Louise who has to think about it and that's what makes her sad.
We all live together on 10 rue des Mauvestis.
It's an old word that means "bad clothes," but we're well dressed, without a hole, all five of us, and we have television.
Mémé Za and Grandma Marie-Louise lie in the same room where there is a double bed.
Mom and Dad are sleeping in the blue room.
And I'm sleeping on the couch in the dining room.
In the evening, the whole family is sitting on the couch watching TV.
When it's a cowboy movie, I hold to the end, but singers and love movies, I fall asleep.
Then I slip behind them.
I lie down, I have four backs that hide from me television, especially the back of memme Za; it is a terrible shadow.
I don't see anything anymore and I fall asleep.
