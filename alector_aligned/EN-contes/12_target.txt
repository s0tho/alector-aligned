It was a huge tree.
It spread its branches in the middle of the jungle.
At the top, at the top, a bird had made its nest and young were born.
An elephant passed.
He liked to scratch his back: he approached the tree and rubbed strongly against the trunk.
The whole tree moved and cracked.
In their nest, the little ones were afraid: they hid near their mother.
"Oh! Grand Master of the jungle, there are enough trees around you! Don't shake this one.
My children are afraid. They can fall from the nest and break their bones."
The elephant wouldn't answer.
He stared at the bird in his tiny eye, moved the air with his giant ears and left.
The next day he returned and grated again to the trunk of the tree.
The worried little birds huddled against their mother.
The mother was very angry."I forbid you to shake this tree," she cried, "or I will punish you!
"You, you poor beast of nothing!" cried the elephant. "What could you do against a giant of my size?" If I wanted to, "I'd drop that tree and your nest at the same time!"
The mother bird doesn't say anything.
On the third day, the elephant returned to scratch against the trunk of the tree.
Fast as lightning, with a stroke of wings, the mother entered her immense ear.
Once she tickled him and scratched him with a paw.
Although the elephant moved its head, the bird did not stop.
The elephant asked the bird to come out.
"I also asked you not to scare my little ones," said the mother.
The elephant was screaming, raising his trunk, running like a madman through the jungle.
Finally, the elephant fell exhausted.
The bird then left the ear and returned to his nest with his children.
Never again did the elephant return to this place to scratch his back.
