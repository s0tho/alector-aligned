The flute player did not make himself say it twice.
He went out into the street and played a melody that was both sweet and strange and captured the attention of all the children of the city.
Some stopped playing the marelle or hunting in the alleys, rushed out of their house, others stopped squashing or hunting at the stone-throwing whirlwinds...
As bewitched by music all, from the smallest to the largest, began to run behind the flutist.
The parents called their children, but even though they called them to order, scolded them, threatened to be severely punished, the children never obeyed.
The flute player trained them out of town.
They arrived at the foot of a mountain in the flanks of which suddenly opened a large door.
The flute player entered and all the children followed him.
Only a little boy was lagging behind; indeed, he was drinking and couldn't walk as fast as the others.
But the door closed with a gloomy noise.
When the poor parents, wretched and extremely worried, arrived at the scene, they found only the little boy in tears.
The parents of the missing children lamented, to the height of despair.
The only child left in town was the poor lame, so sad that he could not play with his friends.
However, life continued in Hamelin, but for many years it was the saddest city in Germany, for the children were no longer there to cheer him with their cries and laughter.
And every day, parents wept for the memory of their beloved children.
