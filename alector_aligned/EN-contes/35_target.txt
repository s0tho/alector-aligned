The cat resumed its taste for life.
One day, the white mouse caught him training in front of a mirror.
First, he practiced slipping without noise near a screwdriver.
But one day the white mouse and two of his friends were sitting on bags of wheat at the top of the mill, having fun tearing up old newspapers. There was a terrible cry.
He was the furious miller screaming, holding his cat by the skin of his neck.
Despite the noise of the machines and wings of the mill, mice could hear what he was saying.
He's been yelling at the cat, ever since I bought you, there's more mice than ever, you're not serving anything. I'm going to put you in a big bag. I'll throw him in the river tonight!
"Although we are sworn enemies," she said, "we don't want the miller to drown you. "If we help you run away, will you promise us to make peace with us?"
The bag moved its head as a sign of agreement.
A group of mice led by their chief went to take the fur cap of the miller's wife from the coat rack.
They brought the cape into the shed.
When they arrived other mice had already delivered the cat by eating the links that kept the bag closed.
Then they filled the fur cap with straw and hung on a horse iron to weigh the bag, which they closed.
The miller, convinced that the cats were useless, did not buy any more.
But he didn't know that the big titrated cat, happier than ever, was still living at the top of the mill with the mice, who brought him all kinds of stolen dishes in the pantry of the house.
And they all spent their time playing together with the cat and the mouse.
