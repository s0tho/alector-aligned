Once upon a time there was a little fairy who had a very big nose.
She didn't like him at all.
Moreover, this naughty nose began to sink one day and she had to stop welcoming the newborns, for fear of passing their cold.
It couldn't last anymore and the little fairy decided to change her nose with the help of her magic wand.
It didn't work: it became blue... it became red... it became red white blue, but it still remained as big.
She tried her magic wand on the nose of others. It worked very well. It even worked backwards and she put noses where there is not usually.
- This wand does everything I order her, except shorten my nose, says the little fairy. And she went to visit the other fairies to ask them for help. She first saw the fairy Tignasse and asked her:
- Would you order your magic wand to shorten my nose?
- I would have done you this favor, assura Tignasse, but my wand can only lengthen. Look what beautiful hair she gave me. These are the longest in the world.
Then she saw the fairy Carabosse and said to her:
- I'd like to change my nose, but my wand doesn't work on me.
"It's very easy," replied Carabosse. "In a second my wand will give you a nose as beautiful as mine.
- No, no, thank you! exclaimed the little fairy by running away at all speed.
