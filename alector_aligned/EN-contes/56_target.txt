There was a grand duke who liked new clothes, and he spent all his money on his clothes.
When he reviewed his soldiers and went to the show or to walk, he wanted to show off his new clothes.
Every hour, he changed his clothes, and instead of saying "he's on the board" he was said "the grand-duke is in his closet."
The capital was a cheerful city because many foreigners came. One day two thieves arrived, pretending to be able to weave the most beautiful fabric in the world.
The colours and the drawing were beautiful, but the clothes made with this fabric had a magical quality: they became invisible to anyone who did not work well or who was foolish.
These are expensive clothes, thought the Grand Duke, and with these clothes I can know the stupid men of my government.
Then he gave the two thieves a lot of money so that they could start the work right away.
They set up two trades, and pretended to work, but there was nothing on the reels.
They constantly asked for fine silk and magnificent gold; but they put all this in their bag, working until the middle of the night with empty trades.
- I need to know where they are, says the Grand Duke.
But he felt his heart tight when he thought that people who were foolish or unable to perform their duties could not see the fabric. It was not that he doubted himself; but he thought about sending someone to examine the work before him. All the inhabitants of the city knew the wonderful quality of the fabric, and all burned with impatience to know how limited or incapable their neighbour was.
- I will send to the weavers my good old minister, thought the great duke, it is he who can judge the fabric best; he is distinguished by his mind as well as by his abilities.
The honest old minister entered the hall where the two thieves worked with empty trades.
"For God's sake!" he thought, opening his eyes, "I can't see anything." But he didn't say a word about it.
