Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sophie who had always lived with her grandfather.
One day, the old man went to the attic to pick up a box where he had preciously kept multiple memories accumulated throughout his life: a letter yellowed by time and scrutinized with black ink, a box of matches with mysterious inscriptions, some coins that Sophie had never seen before, a ribbon of the color of the faded roses that the grandfather kissed in silence, the black and white photograph of a little boy with curly hair... and so many other treasures.
At one point, the grandfather plunged his entire hand under a pile of postcards, searched the bottom of the box, and then pulled his fist out.
He turned his palm into heaven and gently opened his fingers, revealing in the eyes of the little girl a kind of gold-coloured nugget that shone with a thousand fires.
- "My little Sophie, this is the seed of a magical tree. You just have to plant it under a few centimetres of soil, in a place in the garden that you love, provided it is in the sun and sheltered from the wind...
A magic tree, but what magic are you talking about, Grandpa?
- You will know if you cherish and protect this seed, then the tree that it will bring forth, as well as the secret that it holds. Now go, little one."
