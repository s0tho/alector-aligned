The elephant barred to greet another elephant, to remind his little one to order, to show his fear or his anger. These bars vibrate throughout the bush...
However, this is not the only way to communicate orally.
Let us follow a group of elephants who advance in the savannah, in small separate groups, on a line of several kilometers.
Suddenly the troupe stopped, changed direction or speed.
But why do elephants have such a strange attitude?
If you were in the middle of the elephant troupe, then you would have felt a strange impression, a kind of deaf rumbling. It looks like the distant rumbling of a plane very high in the sky.
The human ear doesn't really hear it, but we see something deaf in the air.
This very serious sound is the other voice of the elephants.
They emit infrasounds: very serious sounds that men normally don't hear. But we can record these sounds with specialized devices.
Infrasounds are understood from afar because they are not changed by distance.
Elephant troops, several kilometres apart, can thus warn of the presence of a water point, of the fatigue of one of the young or of the existence of a danger, such as an earthquake or a tsunami.
The elephants all stop at the same time, the ear stretched for about a minute to hear these signals better.
Once the message is heard, the elephants stop, change direction or accelerate their march.
Elephants first communicate through vocalized sounds or sounds, known as rumbles.
These rumblings have basic frequencies in the field of sound.
These frequencies cannot be heard by humans, even if their melodies can be heard.
