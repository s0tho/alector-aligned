Once upon a time, two peasants lived in a village on Mount Lebanon.
They had a small field with fertile soil.
The husband cultivated wheat and corn there.
Around their house, the man planted three olive trees and two orange trees.
With the olives, he made oil for their personal consumption and when the harvest was very good, he sold it to his neighbors.
As soon as the orange trees began to bloom, the woman rose with the day to pick up the flowers still in button.
It only interrupted its daily harvest when the sun's rays became too aggressive or bees too numerous.
She then opened the buttons to separate the petals with which she made orange blossom water that she sold at the market.
This peasant couple had a single daughter who was of marriageable age.
She was named Warda.
She had long jais hair and almond eyes.
All the young men in the village dreamed of marrying her.
But the mother told all the suitors that only the one who would give her daughter a gift unique to the world would get her hand.
Boys didn't know what to do.
Some proposed their donkeys, others their dromedary. The mother shook her shoulders while smiling.
- Asses and dromedaries, we find them everywhere, she threw them at them.
It's a unique gift to my daughter.
Warda married the boy she had chosen and they lived happily.
The whole village found Warda's choice wise.
She had decided to take as the most generous husband of the suitors.
