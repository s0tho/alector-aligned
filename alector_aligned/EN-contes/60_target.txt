In a small town, a fruit seller had a store above a deep cellar.
Every night a lot of mice came from that cellar in the store.
They ate apples and pears, grapes and nuts, and also vegetables and potatoes.
From evening to morning, the little rodents did not forget any merchandise from the store.
At night, when there was noise in the streets, the mice were in silence in the cellar.
From midnight they all came, had fun with the sweet fruits and ate a lot.
The traces of the mice made the seller angry.
He was trying to protect himself from mice.
