Ouoro was a beautiful monkey, living at the zoo.
Ouoro was turning round in his cage.
On a Sunday, he tried to open the door and shook it with all his strength.
The door was badly closed, it opened...
The monkey came out of his cage.
He followed the way to the trees.
Suddenly, he saw a black car stopping near him.
A man went down and gave him his hand. The monkey let himself be driven to the black car. The car started and rolled for a long time.
At last the car arrived, there was a party in the square and a little circus.
The man brought down Ouoro and put a chain around his neck.
"I'll teach him how to swell the balloons and shelter him in the courtyard," said the man.
In a workshop, the man swollen the colored balloons, selling them the next day at the fair.
Often in the evening, Ouoro helped his new master. At night, the monkey slept in the workshop. He was not attached.
He could not save himself: how could he have climbed those large walls that closed the courtyard?
One day, he had an idea, and all night, he swung balloons.
When they were round, Ouro tied them with a solid rope.
In the morning, a hundred balloons were ready to fly.
Ouoro was happy to see a nice wind rise. He shook the trees.
Carefully, he pulled all these balloons by the rope.
Then he shook the ropes well, and clung his feet and hands, and the balloons went away. Ouoro climbed up, climbed into the air.
Soon it came higher than the wall of the court.
