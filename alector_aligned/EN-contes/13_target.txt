The four-and-a-half-hour bell just rang. Mrs. Morot stops her story and says:
"It's over for today. We'll continue tomorrow."
An eight-year-old girl gets up fast.
"Please, ma'am! Finish Robert's adventures!
- No, it would be too long, Emilia. I said tomorrow."
She's gonna put her stuff in a row, and she's gonna shove, and the mistress looks at her with an amused look.
"As you're very interested in the subject, Emilia, you'll tell us the rest tomorrow. Okay? You'll imagine an end in your own way.
- All right!"
Emilie runs without turning around. Her briefcase swings on her shoulders. She begins to imagine Robert's adventures in her head. Suddenly, she slides on something round and hard: a pencil. She falls down, picks him up, puts him in her pocket and resumes her race.
Arriving at her home, Ã‰milie goes to her room. The little girl runs to her office, spreads a large sheet of white paper and cuts the pencil.
"Oh, I have an idea! I'm going to draw a big snack! A brioche with jam."
Emilie then draws a big brioche. She adds a jar of jam and pays attention to drawing the fruits inside. Emilie adds a small spoon and puts the pencil on her desk. A few seconds later, the brioche swells. Next, the pot and spoon also come out of the paper. Surprised, eyes wide open, Emilie is in front of a good snack.
