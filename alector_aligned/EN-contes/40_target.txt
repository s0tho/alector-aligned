Thursday, after eating, I had a little more time before I met the buddies outside. I sat in the chair. I took the paper that Dad had left before leaving at work.
As usual, apart from photos and drawings, there was nothing to read in the paper, except on the last page, and that was great!
There was a big contest, and the first prize was a car!
You could see the picture of the car, it was a beautiful car like anything.
For the contest, they said that every day they would give a picture of a monument. You had to recognize it and tell where it was.
They gave an example. I saw right away that it was the Eiffel Tower, the one in Paris.
I am very strong for the monuments and I know a lot of them: there is the statue of Jean-Jules Tremp√© (1864-1930), with a beard and pigeons, near the school, in the square. And then the statue of Poirier-Lamarre, who was a pirate. It is located in Bains-les-Mers, not far from the Beau-Rivage hotel, where we spent a holiday with Dad and Mom. We saw the statue from the dining room, leaning over. It is a nice iron statue. She looks through a long view at the beach hotel. In the contest they will surely talk about it.
