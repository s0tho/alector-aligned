A long time ago, in Japan before, several emperors shared the country.
The emperors fought for a yes and a no.
For this, they asked for help from warriors: the Samurai.
Tenshin wanted to be a samurai since he was a kid: it was his dream.
His parents had enrolled him, even though they were poor, in the best samurai school in the region to make Tenshin a great warrior.
Tenshin worked a lot, not only for him, but also to honor his parents. His parents put their little money in his school fees every month.
Unfortunately, on an autumn day, his teacher told Tenshin that he was not big enough, nor strong enough to become a good samurai.
The teacher asked him to leave school and look for another profession.
Tenshin left the martial arts school with shame. He went out looking for a new meaning in his life. He would never be a great samurai.
But as he was crying with all his heart, he met an old salmon fisherman.
Tenshin stayed with the fisherman for a while. He learned a lot because he was a very wise old man.
The spring came, and the old fisherman no longer needed him, and they said to himself at good-bye:
- Remember Tenshin, it is not the size or the strength that make a great samurai, but the force of mind and intelligence.
