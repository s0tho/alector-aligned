The farmer Jean and his wife Mariette had no children, which made them very sad.
On a winter night, they saw something weird in the yard.
"A leprechaun?" asked Mariette.
The farmer came up and said to him, laughing:
"He's just a snowman!"
The farmer was advancing in her turn.
"Look, Jean," she said, "it looks like a lost child, abandoned by his friends. He stopped outside our door. He is looking for a shelter at home.
You're kneeling in front of this pile of snow... my word, she takes the guy in her arms...
Miracle, Jean, it's no longer a ball that serves as a head for the man! It's a child's face! He's opened his eyes... Here, all his white coat has melted... Look, he's moving! He lives!
- It's true... a child, a boy... oh, he closes his eyes... let's hope he won't be a statue anymore...
- No, he just falls asleep... Here, take him in your arms, we'll carry him in the house."
The farmer entered and placed the sleeping child on an armchair in front of the high fireplace. Mariette went to get wood. She threw him into the fire. A flame appeared. At the same time, the boy woke up with a cry of fear. He jumped and ran to hide away from the fire. The boy said, showing the flame:
"The fire would make me leave. There is only one way to warm me up, it is to love me. Your love has made me live. I am the child of your love.
What are we going to call him, our snow child?
- If we called it Christmas... Christmas, isn't it a snow party?" says the man.
