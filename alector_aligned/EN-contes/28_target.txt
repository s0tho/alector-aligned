Once upon a time a fairy had a very big nose.
She hated him.
Moreover, this horrible nose began to sink one day and she had to stop saying hello to the babies, for fear of passing their cold.
The fairy decided to change her nose with the help of her magic wand.
It didn't work: it became blue... it became red... it became red white blue, but it still remained as big.
She tried her magic wand on the nose of others. It worked very well. It even worked backwards and she put noses where there is not usually.
- This wand does everything I order her, except to shorten my nose, says the fairy. And she went to the other fairies to ask them for help. She first saw the Tignasse fairy and asked her:
- Will you order your magic wand to shorten my nose?
- I would have done it, assura Tignasse, but my wand can only lengthen. Look what beautiful hair she gave me. These are the longest in the world.
The little fairy went back, and she was sad, and then she saw the fairy Carabosse and said to her:
- I'd like to change my nose, but my wand doesn't work on me.
"It's very easy," replied Carabosse. "In a second my wand will give you a nose as beautiful as mine.
- No, no, thank you! shouted the little fairy, and she left very quickly.
