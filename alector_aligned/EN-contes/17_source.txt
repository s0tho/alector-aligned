That night Hugo slept deeply at the bottom of his apple, when suddenly terrible shakings stirred the fruit.
What a storm!
Hugo barely had time to jump out of his bed, which he fell to the reverse, shouting with fear: "Help! Help!"
Outside, the conspirators were very happy about it.
They shook the apple, shook it, shook it, and so much so that it broke out of the branch and fell at the foot of the tree.
Hugo, who had not hurt himself, was gesticulating, furious in the middle of his house in pieces.
What a mess!
He's naked now... naked like a worm!
Naked like a worm, exclaimed his friends and laughed.
Unfortunately, our asticot didn't understand the joke and went away cursed, penaud, angry, ridiculous.
But since he had never spent the night outside, he was very worried.
Then he slipped into a cabbage.
It was the house of a big, terribly chatty slug named Grace.
- Oh, my God, what you're pale! Here, eat some cabbage, it's excellent for your health.
- Thanks, but I...
Ta-ta-ta, eat some, eat some.
- I still prefer to bite in apples, murmured rather loudly the ass.
- Ta-ta-ta, take some more. I insist, and don't talk full mouth, little cabbage, it's very badly raised, she says.
