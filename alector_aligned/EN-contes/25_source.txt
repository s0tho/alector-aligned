Mr. Seguin had never had any happiness with his goats.
He was losing them all the same way.
One morning they broke their rope, went to the mountain, and there the wolf ate them.
Neither the caresses of their master, nor the fear of the wolf, nothing held them.
They were, it seems, independent goats, wanting at all costs the open air and freedom.
The brave Mr. Seguin, who did not understand the character of his beasts, was dismayed.
He said, "It's over, the goats are bored in my house, I won't keep one."
However, he was not discouraged, and after having lost six goats in the same way, he bought a seventh one; only this time he took care to take it at a young age, so that she might get used to staying at home.
Oh, how pretty Mr. Seguin's little goat was.
How pretty she was with her soft eyes, her non-commissioned barbiche, her black and glossy hooves, her zebra horns and her long white hairs that made her a houppeland!
And then docile, caressing, letting herself milk without moving, without putting her foot in the stable, a love of little goat.
Mr. Seguin had behind his house a fence surrounded by hawthorns.
That's where he put his new resident.
He tied her to a stake in the most beautiful place on the meadow, taking care to leave her a lot of rope, and from time to time he came to see if she was well.
The goat found herself very happy and grazed the grass with such good heart that Mr. Seguin was delighted.
