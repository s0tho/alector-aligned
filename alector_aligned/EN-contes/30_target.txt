Once upon a time there was a snail who suffered a lot every time he went on a walk because he had difficulty following the rhythm of his companions.
The ladybug was fast like a mouse, the mille-pattes, with its thousand legs, did not know fatigue, the beetle took time to make escapades.
The little snail, however, was painting, blowing, sweating all alone and far behind, abandoned by others who no longer had the patience to wait for him.
When the little snail finally managed to join the group, the other little animals had already rested well, had eaten well and after playing well, had prepared the camp and had been sleeping for a long time.
And since there was no room left, the little snail had to sleep outside.
But every morning, obstinate, he was back on the road, always hoping to catch up with his friends.
In order not to get bored during the course, he whistled, looked to the right and left, greeted the little animals he met.
One day he walked his nose in the air to admire the flight of a beautiful butterfly, the little snail struck a hard surface that made him lose his balance.
- Well, what's that?
It was a shell lost by a child who had brought him from the seaside.
Of a curious natural, and as the thing did not move, the little snail went to see more closely and looked at the inside with attention.
On his way home, he saw that she was at her waist and lighter to wear.
Then shouted the little snail, and I'm going to make a house of it.
And he started the shell on his back.
When he arrived at the camp, everyone was already asleep. The next morning, when he left his shell, the little snail was very successful.
