Once upon a time there was a poor snail who suffered a lot every time he went on a hike because he had difficulty following the rhythm of his companions.
The ladybug was as fast as a mouse, the mille-pattes, with its thousand legs, ignored fatigue, the beetle even took the time to get away.
The poor little snail, however, was painting, blowing, sweating all alone and far behind, abandoned by others who no longer had the patience to wait for him.
When the little snail finally managed to join the group, the other little animals had already rested well, had eaten well and after playing well, had prepared the camp and had been sleeping for a long time.
And since there was no room left, the little snail had to lie down with the beautiful star.
But every morning, obstinate, he was back on the road, always hoping to catch up with his friends.
In order not to get bored during the course, he whistled, looked to the right and left, greeted the little animals he met.
One day he walked his nose in the air to admire the flight of a beautiful butterfly, the little snail struck a hard surface that made him lose his balance.
- Well, what is it? He asked himself because he had never seen anything like it.
It was a shell lost by a child who had brought him from the seashore.
Of a curious natural, and as the thing did not move, the little snail went closer and inspected the interior carefully.
As he entered it, he realized that she was perfectly at her waist and lighter to wear.
So jubila the little snail, I'm going to make a house of it.
And he started the shell on his back.
When he arrived at the camp, everyone was already asleep, but the next morning, when he left his shell, the little snail was very successful.
