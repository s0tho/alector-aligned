Mr. Seguin was not happy with his goats.
He was losing them all the same way.
In the morning the goats broke their rope, they went to the mountain and the wolf ate them.
Neither the caresses of their master, nor the fear of the wolf, nothing held them.
They were independent and wanted the open air and freedom.
Mr. Seguin didn't understand his goats, he was disappointed.
He said, "It's over, the goats are bored in my house, I won't keep one."
But he did not despair, and even after losing six goats, he bought a seventh goat. This time, he bought it when he was young so that she could get used to living at home.
Oh, how pretty Mr. Seguin's little goat was.
She had pretty eyes, a barbichette, black and shiny hooves, horns with stripes and long white hairs that made her a cape!
She was wise, loved caresses, let herself milk without moving. She didn't put her foot on her plate. She was a little goat's love.
Mr. Seguin had behind his house a meadow closed by shrubs.
Mr. Seguin put his new goat in it.
He tied her to a picket in the most beautiful place on the meadow. He left her a lot of rope and from time to time he came to see if she was well.
The goat was very happy and ate the grass with pleasure. Mr. Seguin was happy.
