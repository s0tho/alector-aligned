We repeat our play several times a week. At first, it's really a mess, then, little by little, everything gets set up.
Finally, on a Thursday, the mistress announces:
- Tomorrow, we'll go to the party room for our last rehearsal.
Friday rehearsal goes well to the big scene of the fight.
We are three Musketeers against fifteen enemies.
After five minutes, we have to call:
- D'Artagnan, help!
But when Tim arrives, there's a big silence.
He stays there, the sword forward, mute like a carp.
Everybody's starting to laugh.
Tim's a badass.
I don't know what to say anymore.
Lo√Øc grabs Tim by the arm and says:
- I knew you'd miss it!
Fortunately, the mistress interrupted him:
It's all right, rehearsals are for that.
Everybody in place, let's go back!
This time, on entering, Tim shouts:
- Courage, Musketeers! I'm coming! One for one and all for all!
Now he stops, panicked, too late, the whole class laughs again.
Tim lowers his head, but we still see that he's red like a tomato.
