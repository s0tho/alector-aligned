There used to be a man named Jack in Ireland.
One day he met a traveller on his way, and greeted him very kindly.
The stranger took sympathy for this gentleman and said to him:
"I grant you a wish."
Jack thinks carefully and says:
"My wife owns a large leather bag. I hope that what is in this bag doesn't come out until I give the order.
"Agreed!" said the unknown, and he went away.
Shortly after his return, Jack broke his leg and had to lie at home for a whole year, without earning a penny.
His unhappy family was starving when one night a stranger came through.
"I see," he said, "that your family is in need. Let's make a deal. Promise me to follow me in seven years and I'll see that you live so far in opulence.
Who the hell are you?
- I'm the devil!
- Whatever, murmured Jack, I accept this offer Â»
So the Devil went away, and Jack became rich and prosperous.
When the seven years had passed, however, the Devil came knocking on the door.
"The time has come," he said. "I have kept my promise, it is now up to you to keep yours."
Jack said goodbye to his wife and followed the Devil with his big leather bag on his back.
They walked for a while in silence, and then Jack spoke:
"When I was a child, I had fun getting in and out of that old bag. I had to say that I was supple and agile at the time!
- This little game is within the reach of any fool, says the Devil laughing.
- Come on, I'm ready to bet you can't!"
Jack opened his bag, and the Devil, without hesitation, leaped into it with joint feet, thus making himself prisoner.
