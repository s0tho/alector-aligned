Once upon a time there was a little village girl, the prettiest one could have seen; her mother was crazy, and her grandma was even crazier.
This good woman made him make a little red chaperon, which was so well suited to him, that everywhere he was called the little Red Chaperon.
One day, his mother made and baked cakes, and said to him:
- Go see how your big mother is, 'cause they told me she was sick, carry her a cake and that little pot of butter.
Little Red Chaperon immediately left to go to his mother-grand, who lived in another village.
When she passed through a wood, she met the Wolf, who wanted to eat it; but he dared not, because of a few loggers who were in the forest.
He asked her where she was going; the poor child, who didn't know it was dangerous to stop listening to a wolf, said to her:
- I'm going to see my big mother, and I'm going to wear a cake with a little pot of butter that my mother sends her.
- Is she staying far away?
"Oh, yes," said the little Red Chaperon, "it is beyond the mill that you see all over there, over there, at the first house of the village.
"Well," said the Wolf, "I want to go and see him too; I am going by this way, and you by this way, and we will see who will be there sooner."
