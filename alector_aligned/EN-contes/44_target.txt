The wind blows on your face and in your hair.
It moves the leaves of the trees, the grass of the gardens, the waves on the sea and the clouds in the sky.
You can feel it, but you can't see it.
He's invisible.
You can also hear him yelling when he blows very loudly.
The wind is the air that moves in several cases.
It can be weak as if you move a fan or violent.
These winds exist because the sun warms the land and the sea more or less. Sometimes the wind is regular, it is the small breeze that comes from the sea.
Sometimes he's violent and he blows in a storm.
Sometimes it arrives in gusts.
Sometimes it changes direction abruptly, so dead leaves fly in whirlwinds.
A layer of air surrounds the earth: the atmosphere.
This air contains mainly 2 gases: nitrogen and oxygen.
By heating, the gases swell: they become lighter and rise.
Thus, the air heated by the sun rises. It then leaves a vacuum that sucks out the cold.
It causes the wind.
Since the highest antiquity, men have used the force of the wind.
Thus, the wind swells the sails of the ships to navigate the sea.
For thousands of years, the force of the wind allowed the transport of men and goods and the discovery of new land.
