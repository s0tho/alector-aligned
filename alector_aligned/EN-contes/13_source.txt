The four-and-a-half-hour bell just rang. Mrs. Morot interrupted her story.
"It's over for today," she said, "we'll resume tomorrow."
A murmuring of protest rises in the class and a girl about eight years old, with long curly hair, stands like a spring.
"Please, ma'am! Finish the adventures of Messir Robert!
- No, it would be too long, Emilia. I said tomorrow."
Emilie's a bit of a little bit of a packer, she's going to put herself in a row, and she's looking at her as if she's having fun.
"Since the subject is so passionate about you, Emilia, it is you who will tell us the rest tomorrow. All right? You'll only have to invent an end in your own way.
- All right!"
Émilie runs without turning around, her bag swaying on her shoulders, and begins to build in her head the adventures of Messire Robert. Suddenly, she slides on something round and hard. It is a pencil. She falls down, picks him up, picks him up and resumes her race.
Arriving at her home, Émilie takes refuge in her room. The little girl runs to her office, spreads a large sheet of white paper and cuts the pencil.
"Oh I have an idea! I'll draw a huge snack! A brioche, for example, with jam."
Emilie then draws a jolly brioche. Then she adds a jar of jam, taking good care to draw the fruits inside. She adds a little spoon and puts the pencil on her desk. After a few seconds, the brioche starts to swell, slowly. Next, the pot and spoon come out of the paper. Ebahie, eyes scarlet, Emilie is tied up in front of a succulent taste.
