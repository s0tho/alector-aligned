A long time ago, in ancient Japan, several emperors called shoguns shared the entire country.
They fought for a yes and a no.
For this, they called upon legendary warriors: the Samurai.
Tenshin wanted to be a samurai since he was a kid: it was his dream.
His parents had enrolled him, despite their poverty, in the best samurai school in the region so that Tenshin, one day, would become a great warrior.
Tenshin trained a lot, not only for him, but also to honor his parents who put their little money in his school fees every month.
Unfortunately, on a sad autumn day, his teacher explained to him that he was not big enough, nor strong enough to become a good samurai.
He asked him to leave his school and look for another profession.
Shameful of him, Tenshin left the martial arts school and set out in search of a new meaning in his life, since he would never become a great samurai.
But as he was crying with all his heart, he was gathered by an old salmon fisherman.
Tenshin stayed for a while with the fisherman whom he learned a lot because he was an old man full of wisdom.
When spring came, the old fisherman no longer needed him, they said goodbye:
- Remember Tenshin, it is not the size or the strength that make a great samurai, but the vivacity of mind and intelligence.
