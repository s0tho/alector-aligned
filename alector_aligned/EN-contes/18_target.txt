A man named Jack lived in Ireland.
One day he met a traveller on his way. Jack greeted him.
The stranger found Jack nice, and he said:
"I offer you a wish."
Jack thinks carefully and says:
"My wife has a big leather bag. I want nothing out of this bag before I give the order.
"Okay!" said the unknown, and he left.
Shortly after he returned, Jack broke his leg, and he had to lie at home for a whole year, without making any money.
His family was starving, and one night a stranger passed by.
"Your family is poor. Let's make a deal. Promise me to follow me in seven years and I'll make you rich.
Who the hell are you?
- I'm the devil!
- Whatever, says Jack, I accept this offer."
The Devil went away and Jack became rich.
The last seven years, the Devil, came knocking on Jack's door.
"The time has come," he said. "I have kept my promise. You must keep yours."
Jack said goodbye to his wife and followed the Devil. Jack was carrying his big leather bag on his back.
They walked in silence, then Jack spoke:
"When I was a child, I had fun getting in and out of that old bag. I was supple and agile!
- This game is within the reach of any idiot, says the Devil laughing.
- Come on, I bet you can't!"
Jack opened his bag, and the Devil leaped on his feet, and took himself prisoner.
