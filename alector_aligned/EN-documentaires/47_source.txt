All animals that feed on other animals must find their prey.
Many animals seek and hunt their prey while others remain motionless and wait for an unconscious victim to approach them.
A widespread possibility of finding food without much effort is the construction of a trap or net.
The most common example of animals catching others using a web is spiders.
Their sticky canvases are spun in such a fine way that they are barely visible, and usually an insect only notices a canvas when it has caught itself in.
Then the spider only goes to the insect.
Either the spider eats the insect right away or she wraps it in her sticky sons to keep it and consume it later.
