There are 500,000 caves in France.
The most caves are found in limestone soils in southern France.
A cave is formed with water and a rock, limestone.
After a few thousand years, holes are dug like in the gruy√®re, the cave was born.
The rainwater passes through the cave, the hollow and brings it minerals.
A cave continues to form.
The level of the Mediterranean Sea today is 1 Km higher than 5 million years ago.
Then caves were dug more than a mile below the sea.
There's more to discover.
In 1947, a fluo green powder was placed in the water of the Padirac gulf (46) to know the way of the water under the earth.
The green water was found 3 months later and 11 km further. The way to the water under the earth is therefore long.
Geologists study caves to find deep water reservoirs.
But speleologists can't get to some places.
Then you slide a robot into the water to take all the measurements.
Speleologists also throw special logs into the river that advance and give their position.
So we can draw the map of the river.
