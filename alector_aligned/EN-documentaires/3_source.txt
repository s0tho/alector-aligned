390 million years ago, the adventure of forests begins.
This fascinating and mysterious world, still partially ignored, is that of 4 billion hectares populated by trees that cover 30% of the land of our planet.
The forest environment is a laboratory powered by solar energy stored as in a battery -wood- made with carbon dioxide (CO2), water and nutrients drawn from the soil.
Dry or wet, sunny or not, the bare rocks and soils are occupied by so-called pioneer plants because they settle before others and form the first humus.
The mother rock degrades under the combined effect of frost, heat, water and wind. The latter brings the spores of fungi, mosses, lichens and ferns.
On rivers and oceans the floating seeds that settle on the shores are sailed, the lightest being transported by the fawns and plumage of migratory birds.
A phytocenosis, a plant community, settles according to the water resource.
A diverse flora and then shrubs and pioneer trees colonize these bare environments.
This plant mosaic evolves, its complexity also: the tree, then the forest results from this process.
In the forest, plant perspiration amounts to 25 to 50 m3 of water per day per hectare.
With the evaporation of soil and surface water, it is the general evapotranspiration that forms clouds.
Forest soil is a sponge that regulates the circulation of water, recharges underground reserves and feeds sources.
The forest is also oxygen-protective and sets the carbon of the air.
Tree peaks slow down the violent winds that overturn others, which are more fragile.
The cycle of plant reconstitution then begins.
The forest is also a conservatory of still unknown animal and plant species, an important reservoir of genetic biodiversity, an air conditioner for soils.
Thanks to fungi, bacteria and other micro-fauna, forest soil is a plant that recycles organic matter and then restores nutrients to the soil, in which the roots grow.
They pump water, mineral salts and stabilize the growing tree.
