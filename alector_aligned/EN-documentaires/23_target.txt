The storms are beautiful and scary.
Fine because they create a bright light in the sky, but they also scare by their deaf noise and the damage caused.
Cumulo-nimbus is the cloud that brings thunderstorms.
It is black, thick and charged with electricity, static electricity.
It is of negative polarity.
As the cloud grows, it is charged with negative electricity.
On the other hand, the ground is loaded with positive electricity.
In electricity the opposites are attracted, it is this difference of polarity that causes lightning.
The negative loads of the cloud encounter the positive loads of the ground, through the air rendered conductive.
Thunder is the deaf noise that comes with lightning.
As lightning chooses the easiest way to get to the ground, it also chooses the shortest.
This makes it easier to go to the top of a tree or pointed object or height.
That is why we must avoid sheltering under a tree in the event of a storm.
Today all houses and buildings are equipped with a protective system: the lightning rod.
Shelters to avoid: under a tree, under a tower, under an agricultural machine, in a metal hangar or at the edge of a river (water is a conductor of electricity).
If you are in the middle of an empty field or space at the time of the storm, do not run.
Put yourself in a ball on your knees, your feet tight and your arms around your head.
You must have noticed that the sound of thunder and lightning doesn't always happen at the same time.
That's because the storm's a mile away from you.
In fact, the speed of the light is very fast. The image of the lightning comes almost when it is created.
The speed of the sound, on the other hand, is much slower.
The sound of thunder therefore takes more time to reach you (unless the storm is above you!).
