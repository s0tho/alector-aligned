At night, the hedgehog walks under the hedge and also spends in your garden.
Its small pointed snout is perfect for hunting worms and slugs from the garden.
But he's making a noise.
It is therefore easy to find this ball of stings eating a worm in the lawn or chewing a small snail on the salads of the vegetable garden.
He does not see very well but finds his meal under the leaves thanks to his flair or his hearing.
The gardeners thank him because he eliminates from the garden small animals eating vegetables and fruits, no need for pesticides.
In one night, the hedgehog can eat 60 worms or larvae and a good dozen slugs.
He also likes eggs and fallen fruits.
The little ones eat by following their mom.
When the night falls, the hedgehog goes to search for his prey under the hedge.
In winter, the hedgehog sleeps for 5 months on a nest of grasses and leaves.
When he wakes up in the spring, he's very hungry.
The hedgehog is a victim of anti-lima, road and hedge suppression, its natural habitat.
He therefore takes refuge in parks and gardens for the greatest joy of the gardeners.
