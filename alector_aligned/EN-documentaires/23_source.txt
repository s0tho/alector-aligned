The storms are both beautiful and frightening.
Beautiful by the bright light they create in the sky, but also frightening by their deaf noise and the damage they can cause.
The cloud that causes the storm is called cumulo-nimbus.
It is black, thick and mostly charged with electricity. More precisely static electricity.
This one is of negative polarity.
As the cloud grows, it is increasingly charged with negative electricity.
The soil, on the other hand, is loaded with positive electricity.
And as in electricity the opposites are attracted, it is precisely this difference of polarity that is at the origin of lightning.
The negative loads of the cloud join the positive loads of the ground, through the air that has become a conductor.
Thunder is the deaf noise that accompanies lightning.
As lightning chooses the easiest path to reach the ground, it also chooses the shortest.
It is therefore more easily directed towards the top of a tree or any other pointed or high element.
This is why it is not advisable to shelter under a tree in the event of a thunderstorm.
Today all houses and buildings are equipped with a protective system: the lightning rod.
Some shelters to avoid: under a tree, under a tower, under an agricultural machine, in a metal hangar or at the edge of a river (water is a conductor of electricity).
If you are in the middle of a field or any other empty space at the time of the storm, do not run.
Put yourself in a ball on your knees, your feet tight and your arms around your head.
You must have noticed that the sound of thunder does not always occur at the same time as lightning.
That's because the storm's a mile away from you.
In fact, the speed of the light is very fast, which means that, even far away, the image of the lightning reaches you almost at the moment it occurs.
The speed of the sound, on the other hand, is significantly lower.
The sound of thunder therefore takes more time to reach you (unless the storm is above you of course!).
