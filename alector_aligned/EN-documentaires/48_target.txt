Spiders were believed to be guarded from glue from their webs, while flies and other insects did not have this protection.
But that's not true. A spider would stick to its own web if it didn't use a trick.
In fact, spiders can make two types of wires.
That's why spiders first make a web of dry threads that don't stick.
When this one is finished, the spider adds over the glue.
This second canvas on the first one takes the insects.
In order not to hang herself, the spider makes paths in his web.
These paths are so well placed that the spider can go everywhere on his web without sticking himself in.
