For a very long time, humans have been using rocks to make objects, tools, to build houses.
In the past, the houses were built with materials found in the surrounding environment.
All the rocks that man uses are extracted from the earth.
Today, they are processed in different factories.
They are transformed and transported throughout France.
For example, clay is used to make plates, bowls, tiles, tiles.
When it is cooked, the clay becomes hard, but brittle.
Wet clay is a soft rock, easy to shape, but it splits by drying. Moistening the clay allows it to be reworked easily.
To avoid these cracks, simply add sand, in varying amounts, depending on what you want to make.
The gypsum is a soft rock found mostly around Paris.
Heated at 150 degrees in ovens, its water evaporates leaving white powder: plaster.
The plaster is used to smooth walls and ceilings, glues bricks, molds objects, plasters broken legs or arms. The marble is transformed naturally. It is used to build monuments. Many rocks are used by humans.
