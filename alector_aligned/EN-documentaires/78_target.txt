People have always wanted to discover new lands, travel in space or live on another planet.
Life in space, outside the atmosphere, has very different conditions.
In space there is no water or air. The temperature is very low in the shade (-150 to -200 °C). It becomes very high (+200 °C) under the direct effect of the sun.
To live in the space vacuum, man must place himself in a "bubble" (vessel or scaphandre) where he finds the same living conditions as on earth (air, temperature of about 20°C).So he can eat, drink, sleep, live in good conditions.
Astronauts must be in good physical shape before they leave for space. They do a lot of sports before their mission.
They train a lot to cope with their new living conditions.
Astronauts are preparing to live in weightlessness and no longer have the evil of space.
A space station allows several people to live months in space. Astronauts do not need to scapandre because the station contains air but outside it is empty.
The crew mainly performs astronomy, research, medical experiments or technical experiments.
The crew must also keep the ship in good condition.
Assembling elements of the space station requires exits outside the ship.
Men dress with heavy sneakers to survive in space.
They are then connected to the station by one or two safety cords.
Astronauts do a lot of work in space.
