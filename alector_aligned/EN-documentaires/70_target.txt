Measurement is necessary to understand space and time.
Man measures to communicate, compare, remember...
Measuring a length is used to answer questions: "How long is this board?" or "How far is it from Paris to Cannes?"
To measure a volume is to be able to answer the question: "How much liquid does this bottle contain?"
Measuring a mass means being able to answer the question: "What is my weight?"
To have accurate information, you have to measure.
The man has always used his body to measure. The hand and eye give information: it's far, it's close, it's heavy, it's light, it's bigger.
The Greeks, the Egyptians, the Romans used the hand, the foot, the elbow, the fingers as units of measure.
All measures were related to the human body or to the work of men.
But the exchanges were difficult because the Roman foot measured about 29 centimetres, the foot of the Greeks 31 centimetres.
In 1793, the French deputies wrote a law. The length unit of the whole Republic will be called the meter.
Since the invention of the meter, scientists invent, the kilo, the liter... it's called the metric system.
This system is used almost everywhere as a result of wars.
The countries that still resist are the English and the Americans.
The international scientific system is based on the meter.
