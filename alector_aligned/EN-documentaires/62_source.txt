'Islands' are the land parcels cut off from the continent and surrounded by the sea.
The islands can be born when volcanoes arise from the bottom of the sea or when sea levels drop or rise.
A series of islands was born at the end of the last ice age.
When the ice melts, the water flows into the sea whose water level becomes so high that the earth, then lower, is flooded.
Today, only the highest parcels of land emerge from the sea in the form of islands.
Animals and plants that have arrived on a remote island, in any way, cannot usually leave it.
If they want to survive, they are forced to adapt very quickly to their new environment.
For living beings from the islands, there has always been a certain danger of disappearing.
