At the South Pole, men cannot fall from the Earth: they do not have their heads upside down.
If we look at a globe, we can believe that an Australian has his head down.
No, I don't.
The Australian, like the French, is attracted to the center of the Earth.
A force attracts everything on the surface and around the Earth.
It's weightlessness.
For all the inhabitants of the Earth, the "top" is always towards the sky and the "bottom" towards the ground.
Beyond the atmosphere, in space, the astronaut and his capsule are far from the earth.
They are always subject to the gravity of our planet.
But as they had a lot of speed at the launch, they still revolve around her, they're smart.
They're in a state of impoverishment.
The weightlessness (or weightlessness) is not the absence of gravity. It is the union of gravity with the speed of displacement.
The astronaut and his capsule are floating in space.
Similarly, 2 masses in the Universe (e.g. 2 planets) will attract.
The earth is attracted to the Sun.
Why doesn't she run into him?
If the Earth went slower, there would be a shock with the Sun; if it went faster, it would leave the solar system.
It's a well-set system.
