In general, the colours of an animal or plant have an explanation.
The birds see the colors very well.
For many birds, males have an insect-friendly color.
Some animals, which have poison or smell bad, have colors that are noticed.
For example, wasps are easily recognized by their yellow and black bands, and birds quickly understand that they are stung if they attack insects with these bands.
But not all colored animals necessarily have poison.
There are flies that don't sting and make like wasps.
There are animals that protect themselves and become almost invisible.
They look like leaves.
