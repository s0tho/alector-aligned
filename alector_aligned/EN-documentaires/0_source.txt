Soothing hunger seems to be the first goal of food.
But the real goal is to provide every day the essential elements for the life of our 60 trillion cells.
The empty stomach makes noises.
Actually, it was the brain that gave the alarm.
He detected a lack of sugar in the blood and triggered the desire to eat.
From the first bite tastes and smells calm the brain.
After about 20 minutes, the stomach also expresses its satisfaction with chemical and nervous signals.
The liver, the pancreas, and the intestine each confirm the message: "I have eaten enough".
The body is ready to wait for it... at least if the meal can meet its needs.
Because of a menu: grated carrots-steak-p√¢tes-pain-camembert-apple, the body will have to draw from what to breathe, stay warm, grow, fight against microbes, play football or write a text.
The pieces of food are first changed to liquid boiling.
Then they are broken down into small enough elements to cross the lining of the intestine.
Charried by blood, they're going to take their place in the body.
Carbohydrates (sugar pasta, bread, fruit) provide energy.
Steak and cheese proteins make bones, skin, hair, cell membranes, antibodies, hormones, etc.
Fats (fats of meat and camembert, carrot oil, pasta butter) ensure the functioning of the nervous, blood, hormonal and disease defense systems.
Microdoses of vitamins and minerals are required everywhere.
However, the body does not know how to make them.
They must be found in food, but not hindered by anti-nutrients such as dyes, pesticides, fried oil, alcohol or cigarette smoke.
Foreseeing, the body stores sugars and fatty bodies that it does not use immediately.
The rest - the fibres of pasta, bread, carrots and apple - is eliminated, playing in the passage the effect of cleansing sponge of toxic substances.
