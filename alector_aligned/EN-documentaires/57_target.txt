Before that, the mill was used to crush grains of wheat for flour.
In prehistory, the first farmers crushed the wheat grains between two stones to make flour.
Then they imagined making a back and forth movement with a stone held in hand on another stone.
The rotating wheel was invented about 2,000 years ago.
One stone did not move: the dormant; the other moved and crushed the grains: the turning.
Animals or men moved that stone.
At the same time, men imagined turning the stone using the force of water, with large wheels.
This great idea made it possible to make 20 times more flour than with the rotating wheel.
In France and England, the first windmills were built in the Middle Ages.
They are found at the top of a hill to receive the wind.
The wind rotated the 4 wings that moved the main wheel.
Inside the mill, there was a round room at the bottom.
A fireplace was used to heat this room.
From there, a stone staircase went up to the floors where the bags and wheels were laid.
Today, modern windmills have replaced windmills. There is still the coffee mill and pepper mill in the kitchens.
