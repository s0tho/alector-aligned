Trees grow almost everywhere, except in the ice, the eternal snow, on the tops of the high mountains and in the deserts.
When a part of the earth is long enough left to abandon, it grows trees there.
First, the earth is covered with creeping plants.
Then grow bushes, and in their shadow a part of previous plants dies.
Then the trees begin to grow.
When they grow up, some of the bushes in their shadow die.
Thus, over time, a forest is formed. Most trees grow slowly and some can become very old.
When old trees die, young people appear and replace them.
Forests are a natural cover that may not change for a very long time.
Forests are almost everywhere.
