The beaver is an excellent swimmer.
In the water, it can swim at a speed of up to ten kilometres an hour.
It is protected from the cold thanks to its fur made of thousands of hairs and has a thick layer of fat.
His voluminous lungs allow him to stay under the water for 20 minutes easily.
The beaver can not only sleekly cut down trees, but is also an expert in dam construction.
When the beaver kills a tree, it eats a cut in the trunk, so that the upper and lower parts are only connected by a very thin surface.
When the connection is narrow, the wind does the rest.
The small branches are cut by the beaver and stacked as a reserve.
Large branches are separated and used as wood for dam construction.
