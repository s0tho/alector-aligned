The phrases "have a fine palate" or "a good beak" suggest that the taste concerns the mouth.
Error! Because the eyes, ears, nose, memory and imagination come into play.
Before a food enters our mouth, the mechanism of taste starts to work.
The simple words "fresh bread", "chocolate" or "grate of endives" throw an image into our brain.
Imagination projects the sensations that you could have if you ate them.
The colour of food also plays a major role.
The consistency counts a lot: a soft peanut, sticky pasta, a sweet fat does not excite the taste buds.
Comes around the smell.
It first arrives at the nostrils, which can detect more than 3000 different aromas. If one mastics, other aromas arrive.
The palate smells like sweet, salty, bitter, acidic and other unnamed flavours. These flavors are captured by 8,000 papillas, tiny receptors on the tongue and palate.
The flavors are then sent to the brain.
Each person, but also every people, has their perception of flavours, and they are classified as "good" and "bad".
In Western Europe, we rather like acid and salt, the flavours of charcuterie and cheese.
In Eastern Europe, we like acid and bitter (beer, sauerkraut) as in Asia (soya sauce).
The United States and Australia love acid and sugar, as in ketchup.
Only the sweet flavor is recognized and appreciated by all, as it is that of breast milk.
