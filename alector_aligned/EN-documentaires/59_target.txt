Man has long used rocks to make objects, tools and houses.
We used to make houses with materials found in nearby places.
All the rocks man uses come from the earth.
Now they are processed in different factories.
We transform them and then transport them all over France.
For example, clay is used to make plates, bowls, tiles, tiles.
The cooked clay becomes hard but it is brittle.
Wet clay is a soft rock, easy to model, but it cracks by drying. If we wet the clay, we work it more easily.
To avoid cracking, you add more or less sand depending on what you want to make.
The gypsum is a soft rock, many of which are found around Paris.
The gypsum heated to 150 degrees loses its water. There is then a white powder: plaster.
The plaster is used to smooth walls and ceilings, to glue bricks, to make objects, or to plaster broken legs or arms. The marble is transformed in a natural way. It is used to build monuments. Man uses many rocks.
