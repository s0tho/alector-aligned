Measurement is a necessary tool to understand space and time.
If man measures, it's to communicate, compare, remember...
Measuring a length is answering these questions: "How long is this board?" or "How far is it from Paris to Cannes?"
Measuring a volume means being able to answer this question: "How much liquid does this bottle contain?"
Measuring a mass means being able to answer this question: "What is my weight?"
To have very precise information, one must measure.
Man has always used his body to measure: the hand, the eye give information: it's far, it's close, it's heavy, it's light, it's bigger.
The Greeks, the Egyptians, the Romans used the hand, the foot, the elbow, the fingers as units of measure.
All measures were related to the human body or to the work of men.
But the exchanges were very complicated because the Roman foot represented about 29 of our centimetres, the foot of the Greeks 31 centimetres.
In 1793, the French deputies drafted a law. The unit of length that would be used throughout the Republic would be called: the meter.
From the invention of the meter, scientists invented, the kilogram, the liter... it's called the metric system.
This system will then be adopted in most States of the world as a result of wars.
The countries that still resist it are the English and the Americans.
The international scientific system is based on the meter.
