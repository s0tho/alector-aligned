The soil of the Amazon forest consists of sand and clay: it is a poor soil.
Plants feed on the low layer of rich soil that covers the soil.
Trees and plants retain this fine fertile layer thanks to their roots.
Without them, the earth would quickly be swept away by rains, the plants would no longer be able to fix themselves or feed themselves.
Thanks to the perspiration of plants and heat, half of the rainwater returns to the atmosphere as steam.
The humidity of the air remains very high and the rains are heavy.
The other half of the rainwater is used by plants or flows to many streams.
Thus, the forest maintains the balance of the climate.
But despite the impression of power and strength it gives, the forest is a fragile environment.
In the Amazon there are 2000 species of trees!
In France there are 40.
With its 220,000 species of plants, the Amazonian forest has an extraordinary diversity of plants.
This tropical forest rises on three levels:
The canopy receives light.
It is the highest place in the forest, at the top of the tall trees, with their thick foliage.
Some measure up to 60 metres high, such as mahogany, mogno or wacapon.
There grows the majority of the flowers.
The undergrowth, the light still penetrates.
Climbing plants like lianas climb along trunks.
At the fork of the branches, in a debris repository, grow orchids.
They take root in the tree.
They are able to capture the slightest drop of water that falls to use it.
The ground. Only a few light rays pass through the thickness of the leaves.
This area is almost permanently in the dark.
There is a high humidity and a smell of rot.
This is where we find the giant ferns, some shrubs.
Very few flowers grow there.
