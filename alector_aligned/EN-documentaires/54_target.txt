Shells are animals with a soft body and shell.
They are part of the mollusc family.
There are two great kinds of shells.
The bivalves are shells with the shell formed by two attached parts.
Each part is called valve.
Gastropods are shells formed from a single shell in one part.
In man, the skeleton is inside the body.
In shells, the skeleton is outside, it's the shell.
It grows from the edges.
The shell can be reformed if it is broken.
It is made of calcium, as for the bones of humans.
The shells are different in size, thickness, shape, color and surface.
Food gives the shells color.
Certain lines of the shell allow to know the age of the animal, as for the trees.
The soft body is made of 3 parts: the foot; the bag that contains the stomach, intestine, heart, liver, kidneys; the coat that covers the whole and makes the shell.
Some shells have mouths.
Others have eyes to distinguish shadows and movements.
Some can also smell.
Shellfish eat plankton.
Some are herbivores, others carnivores.
Shellfish have predators.
The star of the sea attacks the bivalves.
She manages to separate the valves from the shell. She pulls her esophagus and stomach out of her body and then puts them in the shell.
She sprinkles it and eats it.
Crabs use their pliers to open or break the shell.
Some seabirds, such as gulls, swallowed the entire shell and digested the shell.
