In winter, animals and plants live in cold areas and must find ways to survive.
Many plants remain alive winter in the form of seeds that grow in spring and then turn into new plants.
There are other plants that lose their visible part and, when the temperature warms, they make new branches.
In autumn, many trees lose their leaves and during winter, they do nothing.
Animals use much more energy than plants because they move.
Many animals spend the winter without changing their way of life.
But there is a type of animal that has to change its habits so as not to die of cold.
Some birds have found the solution: they leave in autumn.
