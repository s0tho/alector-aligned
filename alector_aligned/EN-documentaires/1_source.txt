Satellites are spacecraft sent into space.
They receive and then broadcast TV programs, weather data, or they take pictures of our planet.
If all the satellites broke down, we wouldn't have the weather!
In addition, images sent from other continents via TV would no longer arrive live.
We'd only see late matches.
But we'd keep the internet, and it wouldn't stop!
In fact, 80% of the information on the Net flows through cables or fiber optics buried in the ground or at the bottom of the oceans.
We could still listen to the radio that's aired.
Satellites connect humans.
The GPS system uses 30 satellites to cover our land.
So the plane uses its GPS to locate itself.
They also give our position on the road.
The GPS of the car gives its position by calculating the time taken by the signals of 4 satellites to reach it.
They're also monitoring the crops.
The harvester records its position and the amount of grain harvested every 2 seconds.
The farmer then knows the places where it grows the least and where he will have to add the fertilizer.
The earth is surrounded by a fog of satellites. There are more than 2500 satellites operating around the earth.
