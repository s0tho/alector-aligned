Sometimes your brain plays tricks you wouldn't want.
Have you seen, for example, that some people are sick in transportation?
Do you know why? It's from your brain.
Your brain, is an organ that receives a lot of information. They come from different parts of your body (either from the outside or from the inside of the body itself).
Your brain processes this information to make you react (e.g. run in the face of a danger) or to launch other mechanisms (e.g. balance when you move) or to store them for later use (e.g. memorization).
It's like a big computer that controls everything your body does.
Now, what happens when you're in the back of your parents' car and you're doing something other than looking at the landscape, for example, you're reading?
The sensors of your retina, in the eye, receive information from the book: Sensitive nerves will carry the information to an area of your brain that will decode it: I am still reading.
On the other hand, the rest of your body gives your brain signs of what you're doing.
Your ears have organs that tell your brain that you're moving.
So your brain receives 2 opposite information and he can't understand this mystery.
On one side I move, on the other, I am still reading.
This conflict causes vertigo, you're not feeling well.
The driver does not have these unpleasant sensations: his eyes and ears give his brain the same information.
