From our planet, men look at the universe.
In the sky we see the Sun, the clouds, the night, the Moon and the stars.
Long before us, the first men saw that the stars were moving in the night.
The Egyptians had drawn maps of the sky, and they knew the planets were moving.
In South America the Mayan peoples have created pyramids.
Today we know that the Maya have built the pyramids in relation to the sky.
Still in our day, we don't know everything.
Every day, researchers study the solar system and the universe: they make discoveries.
The light of the Sun emits all the colors.
The air is a filter.
The sky of our planet is blue.
Without the atmosphere, the sky would be black.
That's the case on the moon.
In a space shuttle, astronauts see the sun and stars on a black sky background: space is a "black light".
Without atmosphere on Earth we could see the stars in broad daylight.
The atmosphere covers the earth.
One part is made of a very large number of very fine particles of very small dusts and drops of water.
The light has all the colors of the rainbow.
The rays of light strike the molecules (very fine particles) of the air.
When the radius is blue, it is diffused.
The other colors remain.
That's why we see the blue sky.
Depending on the air quality, the dust returns yellow waves and adds yellow to the sky.
In the mountains, the days of the sun make a deep blue sky, because the air is very clean. There is no dust or humidity.
On other planets, the sky has a different color, depending on its atmosphere.
