The rainbow is probably one of the most beautiful optical and meteorological phenomena to observe.
The rainbow is an optical phenomenon due to the reflection, refraction and dispersion of the coloured radiations that make up the sunlight through the raindrops.
Depending on the cultures, it is considered to have between 3 and 9 colours.
In the West, there are usually 7 of them: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and purple. But this represents only a tiny part of the colors.
Indeed, some of them are not perceptible by the human eye and others are not sufficiently different from the neighbouring colors to be differentiated, which explains why our organ sees only a limited number of colors.
Two people will never see the same rainbow.
Because the water droplets through which the light passes are constantly in motion.
Also, their appearance changes and the light radiation bounces with completely different angles depending on the moment.
Moreover, if all the raindrops refract and reflect the light, it is only the light of a small part of the drops that will reach the eye of the observer according to its position.
If a rainbow needs the rays of the sun to form, how can it appear at night?
When the moon is full or almost full, the place of the sun is punctuated.
The light it emits also strikes rain or humidity drops and causes the appearance of the light spectrum.
This is called a lunar rainbow, but it is much paler than the traditional form.
In addition, the night must be clear for the rainbow to appear.
It is impossible to reach the end of a rainbow.
You can try to move, change angle, it is impossible to reach the end or "foot" of a rainbow.
For the simple and good reason that the colored radiations that form the phenomenon depend on the distance and angle to which the observer is located.
If you move, the rainbow moves with you.
That's why some legends say there is a hidden treasure at the foot of the rainbows.
