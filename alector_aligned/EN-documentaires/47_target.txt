All animals that eat other animals must find their prey.
Many animals seek and hunt their prey. Others do not move and wait for a victim to come near them.
A common possibility to find food without much effort is to build a trap or a net.
For example, the animal that catches others using a web is the spider.
Their sticky canvases are made in a fine way: they are almost invisible. An insect sees a canvas only when it has caught itself in.
Then the spider has only to go to the insect.
The spider eats the insect right away or he covers it in his sticky sons to keep it and eat it later.
