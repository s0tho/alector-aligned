The words "have a fine palate" or "a good beak" suggest that taste is only a matter of mouth.
Error! Because the eyes, ears, nose, memory and imagination come into play.
Even before a food comes close to our mouth, the mechanism of taste starts.
The simple words "fresh bread", "chocolate" or "endive gratin" automatically trigger an image in our brain.
Imagination then projects the sensations that one might experience again by eating them.
The colour of food also plays a major role.
The consistency counts a lot: a soft peanut, sticky shells, a peaty candy hardly excite the taste buds.
Comes around the smell.
It first arrives at the nostrils, which can perceive more than 3000 different aromas. During chewing, other aromas are released.
The mouth perceives the flavors: sweet, salty, bitter, acid and a number of other flavors that do not have a specific name.
These flavors are captured by 8,000 papillas, tiny receptors located on the tongue and palate, and then sent to the brain.
To each person, but also to each people, his perception of the different flavors and his classification of "good" and "bad".
In Western Europe, we are rather fond of acid and salt, the flavours of charcuterie and cheese.
In Eastern Europe, we like acid and bitter (beer, sauerkraut) as in Asia (soya sauce).
The United States and Australia are fond of the acid and sweet alliance, as in ketchup.
Only the sweet flavor is universally recognized and appreciated, as it is that of breast milk.
