The soil of the Amazon forest is made of sand and clay: it is a poor soil.
Plants feed on the layer of soil that covers the soil.
Trees and plants retain this fine fertile layer thanks to their roots.
Without trees and plants, the earth would be swept away by rains, plants would no longer be able to fix themselves or feed themselves.
Thanks to the perspiration of plants and heat, half of the rainwater goes into the atmosphere in the form of steam.
The humidity of the air is very important and the rains are abundant.
The other half of the rainwater is used for plants, and it also flows to the many streams.
Thus, the forest maintains the balance of the climate.
But despite the idea of power and strength it gives, the forest is a fragile environment.
In the Amazon there are 2,000 species of trees!
In France there are 40.
With its 220,000 species of plants, the Amazonian forest has a huge diversity of plants.
This tropical forest is organized into 3 levels:
1) The canopy receives light.
It is the highest place in the forest, at the top of the tall trees, with many leaves.
Some are up to 60 metres high, such as mahogany, mogno or wacapon.
There grows the majority of the flowers.
2) The undergrowth. The light still comes in until then.
Plants like lianas climb along trunks.
At the fork of the branches, in a debris repository, grow orchids.
They take root in the tree.
They can capture the slightest drop of water that falls.
3) The ground. Only a few light rays can pass through the leaves.
This area is almost always in the dark.
There's a high humidity and a rotten smell.
Here we find giant ferns, some shrubs.
Very few flowers grow there.
