You have sometimes crossed the path of shellfish with a repulsive view and yet very much loved by many people: oysters.
Today we will discover that behind their image, they can be real jewelry creators.
Divided over many seas, oysters are part of the bivalve mollusc family, animals with a shell opening in 2 parts. They live hanging on supports like rocks or buried under sediments (sand, mud, etc.).
Very numerous in some countries, these shells are loved as food and as manufacturers of pearls, used in many jewels.
But then how does this animal make this?
For the oyster, it's a way to treat an outside attack.
The responsible? Rock or sand grains entering his shelter and then causing irritation in his body.
Unable, it is certain, to scratch or to cast out the intruder, the oyster then surrounds it with a material that it often manufactures to form its shell.
This material is called calcium carbonate, a very specific name to designate a matter that you surely know: mother-of-pearl.
The grain is then coated with different layers of mother-of-pearl which, with time and number, will affect the shape and shine of the result.
The grain covered, there's no more irritation, so here we are with a pearl.
This production is therefore a way to remove irritation caused by this grain.
"Bijoux" then exist, depending on the foreign grain and shell: magnificent pearls or simple colored pebbles, different according to the species.
To increase production, some of these animals are grouped into large farms.
We place small balls that will also be covered, thus forming pearls artificially. These implants are sometimes rejected or swallowed. They can cause the death of the animal. It is a dangerous goal for these shells.
