Earth attracts the Moon and the Moon attracts the Earth.
It's called attraction.
The real term is gravitational attraction.
It is the force that any mass exerts on another in the universe.
The oceans are most sensitive to this attraction because they are liquid.
The sea goes up and down twice in 24 hours.
The oceans change when the moon passes in front of them.
When the water is in front of the Moon, the Moon attracts it.
The water is rising.
When the water's finished going up the sea is high.
Every day, the tidal schedule changes by 50 minutes (on average).
If we divide 24 hours and 50 minutes by 4 (number of tides per day), we get about 6 hours 12 minutes.
The sea needs this time, on average, to climb or descend.
For a long time men have used the force of water that rises and descends.
The movements of the sea make currents, these currents move with the tides.
These are tidal currents.
They can be very dangerous for navigation.
The movements of the sea make it possible to use the force of the water.
As early as the 14th century, the Bretons built tidal mills.
These mills walk at low tide, leaving the water held by a wall when there is high tide.
The strength of the water pushes a wheel that creates energy, like the water mill on a river.
In 1961, men did the same to build the only tidal plant in France: the Rance factory.
The tidal water allows turbines to be set in motion that make electricity.
