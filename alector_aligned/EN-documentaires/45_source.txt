Algae are plants.
They appeared more than three billion years ago, the first forms of life on our planet.
Many marine animals eat algae.
They are the starting point for food chains that go to whales.
Some algae are very small, they are not seen with the naked eye while others are giant.
They have different colours: green, red, blue or brown.
In salt or fresh water, and even outside water, they always need light to live.
Algae are plants that have no root, stem, leaf, or flower.
On our planet, the blue algae appeared first, then the reds, then the greens and the browns.
Terrestrial plants come from green algae.
To feed, algae produce sugars from water and gas dissolved in water using sunlight as a source of energy. This is called photosynthesis.
Algae produce more than half the oxygen in our air.
At the same time, they release oxygen.
Algae also feed on the mineral salts of the seawater they absorb.
Without seaweed, there would be no animals.
Everyone can harvest the algae near the water, but be careful, they are important for life on earth.
