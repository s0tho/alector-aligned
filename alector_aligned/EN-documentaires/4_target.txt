The rainbow is the most beautiful of the optical and meteorological phenomena to observe.
The rainbow is due to the reflection, refraction and dispersion, through the raindrops, of the colors that make up the sunlight.
Depending on the cultures, it is considered that there are between 3 and 9 colours.
In the West, there are 7 of them: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and purple. But this is only a small part of the colors.
Indeed, some are not visible by the human eye and others have little difference between them. This explains why our eye sees only a limited number of colors.
Why won't two people ever see the same rainbow?
Because water droplets, crossed by light, always move.
Thus, depending on the moment, their appearance changes and the light rays bounce with different angles.
In addition, if all raindrops refract and reflect light, the observer sees only a small part of the light depending on its position.
If a rainbow needs the rays of the sun to form, how can it appear at night?
When the moon plays the role of the sun.
The light emitted by the moon strikes the rain or humidity drops and causes the appearance of the light spectrum.
This is called a lunar rainbow, but it is much paler than the shape seen during the day.
Besides, the night must be clear to see the rainbow.
It is impossible to reach the end of a rainbow.
You can try to move, change angle, see the end or the "foot" of a rainbow is impossible.
The colours that form the rainbow depend on the distance and angle of the observer.
If you move, the rainbow moves with you.
That's why some legends say there is a hidden treasure at the foot of the rainbows.
